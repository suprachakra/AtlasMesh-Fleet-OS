# AtlasMesh Fleet OS - Non-Functional Requirements

This directory contains the quantified non-functional requirements (NFRs) for AtlasMesh Fleet OS. These requirements define the quality attributes, constraints, and operational characteristics of the system.

## Overview

Non-functional requirements specify how the system should behave, rather than what it should do. They define the quality attributes of the system, such as performance, reliability, safety, security, and usability.

The NFRs in this directory are:
- Quantified with specific, measurable targets
- Referenced in documentation and code
- Used for validation and monitoring
- Enforced through automated tests and CI/CD gates

## Key Files

- `quantified_nfrs.yaml` - The primary file containing all quantified NFRs for the system
- `nfr_validation.py` - Script for validating NFRs against system metrics
- `nfr_dashboard.json` - Grafana dashboard configuration for monitoring NFRs

## NFR Categories

### Performance Requirements

Performance requirements specify the timing, throughput, and resource utilization characteristics of the system. Key performance requirements include:

- **Control Loop Performance**: Latency, jitter, and frequency requirements for control loops
- **Decision Framework Performance**: Latency and throughput requirements for decision-making
- **Localization Performance**: Accuracy and update frequency requirements for localization
- **Telemetry Performance**: Throughput and latency requirements for telemetry data
- **API Performance**: Response time and throughput requirements for APIs
- **Map Service Performance**: Query latency and update propagation requirements for map services
- **Routing Performance**: Calculation time and optimization requirements for routing

### Reliability Requirements

Reliability requirements specify the system's ability to perform its required functions under stated conditions for a specified period of time. Key reliability requirements include:

- **System Availability**: Uptime requirements for the system and its components
- **Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR)**: Recovery time requirements after failures
- **Data Loss Tolerance**: Maximum acceptable data loss rates for different data types
- **Offline Operation**: Duration and functionality requirements during offline operation
- **Fault Tolerance**: Requirements for continuing operation despite component failures

### Safety Requirements

Safety requirements specify the system's ability to operate without causing unacceptable risk of harm. Key safety requirements include:

- **Assist Rate**: Maximum rate of human assistance required
- **Incident Rate**: Maximum acceptable rate of safety incidents
- **Fault Detection**: Time and accuracy requirements for fault detection
- **Safety Case**: Completeness and coverage requirements for safety case

### Security Requirements

Security requirements specify the system's ability to protect data and resist unauthorized access. Key security requirements include:

- **Encryption**: Requirements for data encryption at rest and in transit
- **Authentication**: Requirements for user and system authentication
- **Vulnerability Management**: Requirements for identifying and addressing vulnerabilities
- **Access Control**: Requirements for controlling access to system resources

### Operational Requirements

Operational requirements specify how the system will be operated and maintained. Key operational requirements include:

- **Deployment**: Time and process requirements for system deployment
- **Monitoring**: Coverage and response time requirements for system monitoring
- **Scaling**: Requirements for system scaling in response to load
- **Backup and Recovery**: Requirements for data backup and system recovery

### Sector-Specific Requirements

Sector-specific requirements specify additional requirements for specific sectors. Key sector-specific requirements include:

- **Mining**: Requirements for operation in mining environments
- **Defense**: Requirements for operation in defense environments
- **Logistics**: Requirements for operation in logistics environments
- **Ride-hail**: Requirements for operation in ride-hail environments

### Environmental Requirements

Environmental requirements specify the environmental conditions under which the system must operate. Key environmental requirements include:

- **Temperature**: Operating temperature range and thermal management requirements
- **Weather**: Requirements for operation in different weather conditions
- **Lighting**: Requirements for operation in different lighting conditions

### Compliance Requirements

Compliance requirements specify the standards and regulations with which the system must comply. Key compliance requirements include:

- **Safety Standards**: Requirements for compliance with safety standards
- **Cybersecurity Standards**: Requirements for compliance with cybersecurity standards
- **OTA Standards**: Requirements for compliance with over-the-air update standards
- **Data Protection**: Requirements for compliance with data protection regulations

## NFR Validation

NFRs are validated through a combination of:
- Automated tests in the CI/CD pipeline
- Performance benchmarks
- Load testing
- Security assessments
- Safety analyses
- Compliance audits

The `nfr_validation.py` script can be used to validate NFRs against system metrics:

```bash
python configs/nfrs/nfr_validation.py --nfrs configs/nfrs/quantified_nfrs.yaml --metrics data/metrics/system_metrics.json
```

## NFR Monitoring

NFRs are monitored through:
- System dashboards
- Alerting rules
- Performance metrics
- Log analysis
- Incident tracking

The `nfr_dashboard.json` file can be imported into Grafana to create a dashboard for monitoring NFRs.
