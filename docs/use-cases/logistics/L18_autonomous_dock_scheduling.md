- Environmental: All weather conditions with appropriate adaptations, temperature range -20°C to 45°C
- Time: 24/7 operations with peak handling periods
- Communications: Facility network with yard coverage
- Other: Operation with specialized yard management equipment and dock scheduling systems

**Trigger:**
Carrier arrival, schedule optimization requirement, or dock status change

**Nominal Flow:**
1. System receives dock management mission with scheduling requirements
2. Dock availability assessment and appointment verification
3. Vehicle is equipped with appropriate yard management tools
4. Route planning incorporates yard layout and traffic patterns
5. Navigation to yard entrance or check-in area
6. Carrier identification with documentation verification
7. Dock assignment optimization based on load characteristics and facility status
8. Guidance to assigned dock with precise positioning instructions
9. Dock preparation with appropriate equipment deployment
