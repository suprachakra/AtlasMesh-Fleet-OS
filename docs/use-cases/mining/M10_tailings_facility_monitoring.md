**Trip Type:** INSPECTION_RUN

**ODD (Operational Design Domain):**
- Geographic: Tailings storage facilities, dams, water management infrastructure
- Environmental: All weather conditions with appropriate sensor modes, temperature range -10°C to 55°C
- Time: Scheduled operations with increased frequency during high-risk periods
- Communications: Site network with local processing capability
- Other: Operation on uneven terrain, embankments, and near water bodies

**Trigger:**
Scheduled inspection cycles, precipitation events, seismic activity, or anomaly detection

**Nominal Flow:**
1. System generates inspection plan based on facility risk model and environmental conditions
2. Autonomous vehicle is equipped with appropriate sensor package (LiDAR, multispectral, thermal)
3. Vehicle navigates to inspection waypoints with terrain-aware routing
4. Comprehensive data collection occurs at each monitoring point
5. Real-time analysis identifies potential anomalies (seepage, deformation, vegetation changes)
6. High-priority findings are immediately reported to facility managers
7. Complete dataset is processed for trend analysis and regulatory documentation
8. System updates digital twin of tailings facility with new measurements
9. Risk assessment is recalculated based on new data
10. Inspection report is generated with geospatial tagging of findings
