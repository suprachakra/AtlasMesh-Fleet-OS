**Nominal Flow:**
1. Maintenance planning system schedules road inspection routes
2. System dispatches patrol vehicle with specialized sensing equipment
3. Vehicle navigates inspection route at optimal speed for data collection
4. Multi-modal sensing captures road surface conditions (visual, LiDAR, vibration)
5. Real-time analysis detects defects with classification and severity scoring
6. System geotags issues with precise location and documentation
7. Work orders are automatically generated for prioritized maintenance
8. Maintenance teams receive detailed defect information with repair recommendations
9. System tracks repair status and validates completion
10. Historical data builds predictive models for maintenance optimization
