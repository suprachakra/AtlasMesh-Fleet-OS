**Trip Type:** RECLAMATION_MONITORING_RUN

**ODD (Operational Design Domain):**
- Geographic: Reclaimed areas, rehabilitation zones, closed mine sites
- Environmental: All weather conditions with seasonal monitoring emphasis, temperature range -20°C to 45°C
- Time: Primarily daylight operations with scheduled monitoring campaigns
- Communications: Variable coverage with local processing capability
- Other: Operation with specialized environmental monitoring equipment and sampling systems

**Trigger:**
Scheduled reclamation assessment, regulatory requirement, or environmental event

**Nominal Flow:**
1. System receives reclamation monitoring mission with assessment requirements
2. Monitoring strategy determination based on reclamation phase and parameters
3. Vehicle is equipped with appropriate sensors and sampling equipment
4. Route planning incorporates monitoring points and sensitive areas
5. Navigation to initial monitoring location with precise positioning
6. Deployment of monitoring equipment with calibration and verification
7. Systematic data collection with environmental parameter measurement
8. Sample collection at designated points with proper preservation
9. Visual documentation with comparative imagery and vegetation assessment
10. Mission completion with comprehensive environmental report and trend analysis

**Variants / Edge Cases:**
- Adverse findings: Alert protocols and additional sampling procedures
