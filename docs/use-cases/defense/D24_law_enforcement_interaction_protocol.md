# D24 — Law Enforcement Interaction Protocol

## Basic Information

**ID:** D24  
**Name:** Law Enforcement Interaction Protocol  
**Sector:** Defense  
**Status:** Approved  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-14  
**Owner:** Defense Sector Lead

## Use Case Definition

**Actors:**
- Primary: Law Enforcement Officers, Military Police
- Supporting: Vehicle Operators, Command Staff, Legal Affairs

**Trip Type:** LE_INTERACTION_RUN

**ODD (Operational Design Domain):**
- Geographic: Public roads, base access points, checkpoints, inspection areas
- Environmental: All weather conditions with appropriate adaptations, temperature range -10°C to 55°C
- Time: 24/7 operations with emphasis on high-traffic periods
- Communications: Secure vehicle networks with law enforcement integration
- Other: Specialized interaction systems and documentation capabilities

**Trigger:**
Law enforcement stop, checkpoint encounter, or inspection request

**Nominal Flow:**
1. System detects law enforcement presence through visual identification or signals
2. Authentication of law enforcement authority through uniform, vehicle, or electronic means
3. Vehicle safely reduces speed and pulls over to appropriate location
4. Clear external signaling indicates compliance and acknowledgment
5. Vehicle provides digital identification and mission information through external interface
6. System enables appropriate access to vehicle documentation and manifest
7. Compliance with lawful instructions through predefined interaction protocols
8. Recording and documentation of the entire interaction for legal protection
9. Secure communication with command authorities if required
10. Resumption of mission upon completion of law enforcement interaction

**Variants / Edge Cases:**
- Unmarked law enforcement: Additional verification protocols
- Checkpoint processing: Specialized documentation presentation
- Vehicle inspection: Cooperative access procedures
- Conflicting instructions: Clarification requests and authority resolution
- Emergency situations: Priority override and safety protocols

## Performance & Integration

**KPIs:**
- **P0 (Must have):**
  - Recognition accuracy: ≥98% correct law enforcement identification
  - Compliance rate: 100% adherence to lawful instructions
  - Documentation completeness: Full record of all interactions
  - Response time: ≤5 seconds from signal to acknowledgment
- **P1 (Should have):**
  - Interaction efficiency: Minimize delay while maintaining compliance
  - Communication clarity: ≥95% first-time instruction understanding
  - Authority verification: Multi-factor authentication when possible
  - Command notification: Real-time alerts for significant interactions

**Dependencies:**
- **Services:**
  - `le-interaction-service`: Protocol management and documentation
  - `routing`: Safe stopping location selection
  - `policy-engine`: Interaction rules and compliance protocols
  - `security-monitoring`: Authority verification and recording
  - `alerts-incident`: Command notification and escalation
- **Rules:**
  - `rules/odd/defense/le_interaction.yaml`: Interaction parameters
  - `rules/policy/defense/authority_recognition.yaml`: Law enforcement identification
  - `rules/policy/defense/compliance_protocols.yaml`: Instruction handling
  - `rules/policy/legal/interaction_documentation.yaml`: Recording requirements
- **External Systems:**
  - Vehicle Registration System: Documentation and authorization
  - Command and Control System: Notification and guidance
  - Legal Affairs System: Interaction records and review

**Risks & Mitigations:**
- **Authority misidentification:**
  - Impact: High
  - Mitigation: Multi-factor verification, visual confirmation, electronic authentication, command verification
- **Instruction misinterpretation:**
  - Impact: Medium
  - Mitigation: Clear confirmation protocols, clarification requests, conservative compliance, human escalation
- **Legal compliance issues:**
  - Impact: High
  - Mitigation: Comprehensive documentation, legal review of protocols, jurisdiction-specific rules
- **Security vulnerabilities:**
  - Impact: Critical
  - Mitigation: Limited system access, information compartmentalization, secure communication, tamper evidence

## Validation & Deployment

**Acceptance / Test Hooks:**
- **Simulation Scenarios:**
  - `defense/le_interaction/standard_stop.json`: Routine law enforcement encounters
  - `defense/le_interaction/checkpoint_processing.json`: Base access and checkpoints
  - `defense/le_interaction/inspection_request.json`: Vehicle and cargo inspection
- **Logs/Telemetry:**
  - Interaction metrics: recognition time, compliance verification, instruction processing
  - Documentation metrics: recording quality, information provision, legal sufficiency
  - Security metrics: authentication strength, information protection, access control
- **Gates:**
  - Law enforcement agency acceptance testing
  - Legal affairs review and approval
  - Command authority validation of protocols

**Rollout Plan:**
- **Phase 1:** Basic interaction capability with limited automation
- **Phase 2:** Enhanced recognition and communication capabilities
- **Phase 3:** Full interaction protocol with comprehensive documentation
