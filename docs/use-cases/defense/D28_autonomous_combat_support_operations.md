## Use Case Definition

**Actors:**
- Primary: Combat Commanders, Tactical Operations Centers
- Supporting: Infantry Units, Fire Support Coordinators, Intelligence Analysts

**Trip Type:** COMBAT_SUPPORT_RUN

**ODD (Operational Design Domain):**
- Geographic: Combat zones, forward operating areas, contested territory
- Environmental: All weather conditions with combat limitations, temperature range -15°C to 50°C
- Time: 24/7 operations with day/night combat capabilities
- Communications: Secure tactical networks, encrypted communications, EMCON compliance
- Other: Combat payloads, defensive systems, threat detection equipment

**Trigger:**
Combat support mission request with tactical objectives and threat assessment

**Nominal Flow:**
1. System receives combat support mission with tactical objectives
2. Threat assessment integrates intelligence and situational awareness
3. Mission parameters are calculated based on objectives and threat level
4. Vehicle deploys with appropriate combat support payload
5. Navigation to tactical position with threat avoidance and stealth protocols
6. Mission execution with real-time threat monitoring and adaptation
7. Combat support operations with defensive and offensive capabilities
8. Continuous threat assessment and tactical repositioning as needed
9. Mission completion with tactical withdrawal and status reporting
10. Post-mission analysis and intelligence product generation

**Variants / Edge Cases:**
- Escalating threat level: Dynamic mission adaptation and escalation protocols
- Communications jamming: Autonomous operation with pre-planned contingencies
- Equipment damage: Redundant systems activation and mission continuation
- Friendly fire risk: IFF systems and coordination protocols
- Mission abort conditions: Safe withdrawal and asset protection

## Performance & Integration

**KPIs:**
- **P0 (Must have):**
  - Mission success rate: ≥90% objective completion
  - Threat detection accuracy: ≥95% for known threat types
  - Response time: ≤5 minutes from request to deployment
  - Asset survival rate: ≥95% mission completion without loss
- **P1 (Should have):**
  - Multi-threat engagement: Simultaneous handling of up to 6 threats
  - Weather independence: Operational in conditions up to 40kt winds
  - Night combat capability: Full effectiveness in low-light conditions
  - Coordination effectiveness: ≥90% successful integration with friendly forces
