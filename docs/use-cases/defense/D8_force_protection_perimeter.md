## Use Case Definition

**Actors:**
- Primary: Security Forces, Base Defense Operations Center (BDOC)
- Supporting: Intelligence Units, Quick Reaction Force (QRF), Command Staff

**Trip Type:** PATROL_RUN

**ODD (Operational Design Domain):**
- Geographic: Base perimeters, forward operating locations, secure facilities
- Environmental: All terrain types with appropriate sensor configurations, temperature range -10°C to 55°C
- Time: 24/7 operations with day/night capabilities
- Communications: Secure tactical networks with local processing capability
- Other: Enhanced sensor payload for detection and classification

**Trigger:**
Scheduled security patrols, alert response, or intelligence-driven surveillance

**Nominal Flow:**
1. Security operations generates patrol schedule or alert response requirement
2. System assigns appropriate vehicles with mission-specific sensor packages
3. Vehicles deploy to designated patrol routes or alert locations with optimal spacing
4. Multi-modal sensing continuously monitors for unauthorized activity or perimeter breaches
5. AI-enhanced detection classifies potential threats with confidence scoring
6. Alerts are generated with precise geolocation and supporting evidence
7. Security forces receive actionable intelligence with recommended response options
8. Autonomous vehicles maintain position or adjust coverage based on security protocols
9. System logs all detections and responses for after-action review
10. Patrol data is analyzed to identify patterns and improve future security posture

**Variants / Edge Cases:**
- Active security incident: Enhanced monitoring and QRF support coordination
- Sensor degradation: Adaptive coverage with remaining capabilities
- Communications security threat: Emissions control mode with local processing
- Environmental challenges: Sensor mode switching and adaptive patrol patterns
- Multi-threat scenario: Priority-based alert management and resource allocation
