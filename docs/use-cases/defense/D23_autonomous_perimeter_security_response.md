## Use Case Definition

**Actors:**
- Primary: Security Forces, Base Defense Operations Center
- Supporting: Quick Reaction Force, Intelligence Units, Command Staff

**Trip Type:** SECURITY_RESPONSE_RUN

**ODD (Operational Design Domain):**
- Geographic: Base perimeters, security zones, defensive positions
- Environmental: All weather conditions with appropriate sensor modes, temperature range -20°C to 55°C
- Time: 24/7 operations with heightened readiness during high-threat periods
- Communications: Secure tactical networks with local processing capability
- Other: Enhanced sensor suite for threat detection, specialized security equipment

**Trigger:**
Perimeter alarm, security breach detection, or elevated threat condition

**Nominal Flow:**
1. System receives security alert with location and threat classification
2. Threat assessment integrates sensor data and intelligence information
3. Response vehicles are deployed with appropriate security configuration
4. Route planning incorporates tactical approach and coordinated positioning
5. Rapid navigation to incident location with security force coordination
6. Multi-sensor assessment of the situation with threat verification
7. Establishment of security perimeter with surveillance coverage
8. Support of security force operations through sensor feeds and positioning
9. Continuous monitoring for threat evolution or additional breaches
10. Mission documentation with comprehensive security incident reporting

**Variants / Edge Cases:**
- Multiple simultaneous breaches: Coordinated response with resource prioritization
- Specialized threat types: Adapted response protocols and equipment
- Environmental challenges: Sensor mode adaptation and alternative positioning
- Communications degradation: Autonomous decision making with preset authorities
