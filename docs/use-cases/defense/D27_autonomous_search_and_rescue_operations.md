## Use Case Definition

**Actors:**
- Primary: Search and Rescue Coordinators, Emergency Response Teams
- Supporting: Medical Personnel, Command Staff, Air Support Coordination

**Trip Type:** SAR_RUN

**ODD (Operational Design Domain):**
- Geographic: Variable terrain, disaster zones, combat areas, remote locations
- Environmental: All weather conditions with appropriate limitations, temperature range -20°C to 60°C
- Time: 24/7 operations with day/night capabilities
- Communications: Emergency priority networks, SATCOM, mesh networking
- Other: Enhanced sensor packages, medical equipment, rescue tools

**Trigger:**
Search and rescue request with missing personnel, downed aircraft, or emergency beacon activation

**Nominal Flow:**
1. System receives SAR request with last known position and mission parameters
2. Search area is calculated based on drift patterns, terrain, and time elapsed
3. Optimal search pattern is generated with sensor coverage optimization
4. Vehicle deploys with appropriate SAR equipment and medical supplies
5. Systematic search execution with sensor fusion and AI-assisted target detection
6. Target detection with visual confirmation and status assessment
7. Approach and positioning for optimal rescue operations
8. Casualty assessment and medical stabilization if required
9. Extraction coordination with ground teams or air support
10. Mission completion with casualty handoff and situation report

**Variants / Edge Cases:**
- Multiple casualties: Triage-based rescue prioritization
- Hostile environment: Security protocols and threat assessment
- Weather degradation: Sensor adaptation and search pattern modification
- Communications loss: Autonomous search continuation with data logging
- Equipment failure: Redundant systems and manual override capabilities
