- Supporting: Intelligence Units, Command Staff, Security Elements

**Trip Type:** C_IED_RUN

**ODD (Operational Design Domain):**
- Geographic: Supply routes, patrol routes, high-threat road segments
- Environmental: All weather conditions with appropriate sensor modes, temperature range -10°C to 55°C
- Time: Primarily daylight operations with night capability when required
- Communications: Secure tactical networks with minimal emissions
- Other: Enhanced sensor suite for threat detection, specialized equipment

**Trigger:**
Scheduled route clearance operation or threat intelligence

**Nominal Flow:**
1. System receives route clearance mission with intelligence overlay
2. Threat assessment integrates historical IED data and recent intelligence
3. Vehicle is configured with appropriate detection and neutralization equipment
4. Route planning incorporates threat likelihood and tactical considerations
5. Slow-speed navigation along designated route with comprehensive scanning
6. Multi-modal threat detection using visual, ground penetrating radar, metal detection
7. Upon threat detection, precise positioning and detailed investigation
8. Notification to EOD specialists with threat classification and imagery
9. Standoff or remote neutralization of confirmed threats when authorized
10. Mission documentation with comprehensive threat mapping and action reporting

**Variants / Edge Cases:**
- Complex threat detection: Multi-stage investigation protocols
- Environmental interference: Sensor mode adaptation and verification
- Neutralization challenges: Alternative approach or specialist handover
