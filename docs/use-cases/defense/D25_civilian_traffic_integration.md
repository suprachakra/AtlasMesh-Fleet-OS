## Use Case Definition

**Actors:**
- Primary: Military Vehicle Operators, Traffic Management Center
- Supporting: Civilian Drivers, Local Authorities, Command Staff

**Trip Type:** CIVILIAN_INTEGRATION_RUN

**ODD (Operational Design Domain):**
- Geographic: Public roads, urban areas, mixed-use routes
- Environmental: All weather conditions with appropriate adaptations, temperature range -10°C to 55°C
- Time: Primarily daylight operations with limited night capability
- Communications: Standard vehicle networks with civilian traffic integration
- Other: Enhanced signaling and communication systems for civilian interaction

**Trigger:**
Mission requirement for operation on public roads with civilian traffic

**Nominal Flow:**
1. System receives mission with civilian traffic integration requirements
2. Route planning incorporates traffic patterns and civilian impact considerations
3. Vehicle configuration ensures compliance with civilian traffic regulations
4. Navigation begins with clear external signaling of military vehicle status
5. Predictable movement with enhanced signaling of intentions to civilian traffic
6. Defensive driving with increased safety margins around civilian vehicles
7. Appropriate yielding and right-of-way behavior aligned with local regulations
8. Convoy integrity maintenance while accommodating civilian traffic flow
9. Special maneuver signaling with extended notification time for civilian drivers
10. Mission completion with traffic impact assessment and documentation

**Variants / Edge Cases:**
- Heavy traffic conditions: Patience protocols and flow accommodation
- Unpredictable civilian behavior: Defensive positioning and increased margins
- Emergency vehicle encounters: Priority yielding and safe positioning
- Traffic control points: Authority recognition and compliance
- Hazardous road conditions: Enhanced safety measures and civilian warning

## Performance & Integration

**KPIs:**
- **P0 (Must have):**
  - Safety record: Zero civilian traffic incidents
  - Regulation compliance: 100% adherence to traffic laws
  - Predictability: Clear signaling of all maneuvers
  - Traffic flow impact: Minimal disruption to civilian movement
- **P1 (Should have):**
  - Convoy integrity: Maintained cohesion while accommodating traffic
  - Civilian comfort: Reduced anxiety through predictable behavior
  - Local adaptation: Appropriate regional driving style integration
  - Public perception: Positive impression of military vehicle behavior

  - Mitigation: Professional behavior, courteous interaction, minimal disruption, clear military markings
- **Convoy separation challenges:**
  - Impact: High
  - Mitigation: Adaptive spacing, regrouping protocols, civilian passage accommodation, patience algorithms

## Validation & Deployment

**Acceptance / Test Hooks:**
- **Simulation Scenarios:**
  - `defense/civilian/urban_movement.json`: Operation in populated areas
  - `defense/civilian/convoy_integrity.json`: Maintaining formation with traffic
  - `defense/civilian/unpredictable_behavior.json`: Response to erratic civilian driving
- **Logs/Telemetry:**
  - Safety metrics: proximity events, margin maintenance, defensive positioning
  - Compliance metrics: speed adherence, signaling usage, right-of-way behavior
  - Integration metrics: traffic flow impact, civilian reaction patterns, convoy cohesion
- **Gates:**
  - Traffic safety validation through mixed-environment testing
  - Local authority review and approval
  - Public perception assessment

**Rollout Plan:**
- **Phase 1:** Limited operation in low-density traffic environments
- **Phase 2:** Expanded capability in moderate traffic conditions
- **Phase 3:** Full integration capability across all traffic environments
