## Use Case Definition

**Actors:**
- Primary: Airport Passengers, Fleet Operations
- Supporting: Airport Authorities, Terminal Management, Traffic Control

**Trip Type:** AIRPORT_PICKUP_RUN

**ODD (Operational Design Domain):**
- Geographic: Airport terminals, designated TNC areas, holding lots, pickup zones
- Environmental: All weather conditions, temperature range -20°C to 45°C
- Time: 24/7 operations with peak travel period emphasis
- Communications: Airport network with reliable coverage
- Other: Operation with specialized airport queue management systems and passenger coordination

**Trigger:**
Passenger request, proactive rebalancing, or queue management requirement

**Nominal Flow:**
1. System receives airport pickup mission with passenger details and terminal information
2. Queue position assessment and ETA calculation
3. Vehicle is dispatched to airport holding lot with appropriate timing
4. Route planning incorporates airport-specific access protocols and restrictions
5. Navigation to holding lot with precise positioning in queue
6. Queue advancement with real-time coordination and position tracking
7. Terminal approach authorization based on passenger readiness and pickup zone availability
8. Navigation to designated pickup zone with precise positioning
9. Passenger identification with verification protocols
10. Pickup completion with terminal exit navigation and documentation

**Variants / Edge Cases:**
- Queue congestion: Dynamic replanning and alternative pickup locations
- Terminal restrictions: Compliance with temporary access limitations
- Multiple passenger groups: Efficient batching and route optimization
- Flight delays: Adaptive scheduling and passenger communication
- Special assistance requirements: Accessibility accommodations and extended wait times

## Performance & Integration

**KPIs:**
- **P0 (Must have):**
  - Passenger wait time: ≤5 minutes from ready notification to pickup
  - Queue compliance: 100% adherence to airport protocols
  - Pickup accuracy: ≥98% first-attempt successful passenger matching
  - Terminal congestion impact: Zero violations of dwell time restrictions
- **P1 (Should have):**
  - Fleet utilization: Optimized vehicle allocation based on arrival patterns
  - Energy efficiency: Minimized idle time and unnecessary circulation
  - Passenger experience: ≥4.8/5 rating for airport pickups
  - Airport relationship: Positive authority feedback and compliance metrics
