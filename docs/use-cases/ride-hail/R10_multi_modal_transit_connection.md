# R10 — Multi-Modal Transit Connection

## Basic Information

**ID:** R10  
**Name:** Multi-Modal Transit Connection  
**Sector:** Ride-hail  
**Status:** Approved  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-14  
**Owner:** Ride-hail Sector Lead

## Use Case Definition

**Actors:**
- Primary: Transit Riders, Public Transit Agencies
- Supporting: Transit Hub Operators, City Mobility Managers

**Trip Type:** TRANSIT_CONNECTION_RUN

**ODD (Operational Design Domain):**
- Geographic: Transit hubs, stations, designated connection points
- Environmental: All weather conditions with appropriate adaptations, temperature range -10°C to 55°C
- Time: Aligned with transit schedules, typically 18-24 hours daily
- Communications: Urban network with transit system integration
- Other: Operation in congested pick-up/drop-off zones with specialized protocols

**Trigger:**
Transit connection request or scheduled service aligned with transit arrivals/departures

**Nominal Flow:**
1. System receives connection request with transit details (train/bus arrival)
2. Vehicle is dispatched with timing optimized for transit schedule
3. Real-time transit tracking adjusts ETA to match actual arrival/departure
4. Vehicle navigates to designated transit connection point with precise positioning
5. System notifies rider with exact pickup location and vehicle identification
6. Rider verification confirms correct passenger with transit ticket integration
7. Vehicle transports rider to destination or connecting transit hub
8. System provides transfer instructions if additional connections required
9. Trip completion includes transit system feedback loop
10. System updates performance metrics for transit authority reporting

**Variants / Edge Cases:**
- Transit delays: Dynamic rescheduling with rider notification
- Missed connection: Recovery protocols and alternatives
- Group connections: Coordinated pickup for multiple riders
- Accessibility needs: Specialized handling for mobility-challenged riders
- Transit service disruption: Alternative routing and mode suggestions

## Performance & Integration

**KPIs:**
- **P0 (Must have):**
  - Connection reliability: ≥98% successful transit connections
  - Wait time: ≤5 minutes from transit arrival to pickup
  - Schedule adherence: Vehicle arrival coordinated within ±2 minutes of transit
  - Customer satisfaction: CSAT ≥4.7/5 for transit connections
- **P1 (Should have):**
  - First/last mile coverage: ≥95% of transit stops served
  - Multi-modal trip time: -15% vs. disconnected journey planning
  - Transit ridership impact: +10% on connected routes
  - Energy efficiency: +20% through coordinated scheduling

  - Ticketing System: Fare integration and validation
  - City Mobility Platform: Multi-modal journey planning

**Risks & Mitigations:**
- **Transit timing unpredictability:**
  - Impact: High
  - Mitigation: Real-time transit tracking, dynamic ETA adjustment, buffer time modeling
- **Transit hub congestion:**
  - Impact: Medium
  - Mitigation: Designated connection points, priority access agreements, adaptive positioning
- **Multi-system integration reliability:**
  - Impact: High
  - Mitigation: Resilient APIs, fallback modes, manual override capabilities
- **Peak demand management:**
  - Impact: Medium
  - Mitigation: Predictive capacity planning, dynamic fleet positioning, transit-aligned scaling

## Validation & Deployment

**Acceptance / Test Hooks:**
- **Simulation Scenarios:**
  - `ride-hail/transit/on_time_connection.json`: Standard transit connection
  - `ride-hail/transit/delayed_arrival.json`: Transit delay handling
  - `ride-hail/transit/peak_congestion.json`: High-volume transit hub operations
- **Logs/Telemetry:**
  - Connection metrics: wait times, schedule adherence, success rate
  - Rider experience metrics: transfer walking distance, total journey time
  - System integration metrics: transit data accuracy, ticketing validation
- **Gates:**
  - Transit authority acceptance of integration performance
  - Rider experience validation through controlled trials
  - Connection reliability verification across transit types

**Rollout Plan:**
- **Phase 1:** Single transit hub with limited schedule integration
- **Phase 2:** Multiple hubs with real-time tracking integration
- **Phase 3:** Full network coverage with fare integration and journey planning
