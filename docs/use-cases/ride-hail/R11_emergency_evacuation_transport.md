# R11 — Emergency Evacuation Transport

## Basic Information

**ID:** R11  
**Name:** Emergency Evacuation Transport  
**Sector:** Ride-hail  
**Status:** Approved  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-14  
**Owner:** Ride-hail Sector Lead

## Use Case Definition

**Actors:**
- Primary: Emergency Management Authorities, Evacuees
- Supporting: First Responders, City Operations Center

**Trip Type:** EMERGENCY_EVAC_RUN

**ODD (Operational Design Domain):**
- Geographic: Evacuation zones, emergency routes, shelter destinations
- Environmental: Operation during emergency conditions with appropriate limitations
- Time: 24/7 capability with priority during declared emergencies
- Communications: Resilient networks with emergency services integration
- Other: Enhanced safety protocols, emergency authority override

**Trigger:**
Official evacuation order or emergency management activation

**Nominal Flow:**
1. System receives emergency activation with evacuation parameters
2. Fleet transitions to emergency mode with modified dispatch priorities
3. Vehicles are positioned according to evacuation plan and demand modeling
4. Emergency routing incorporates official evacuation routes and real-time conditions
5. Pickup locations are optimized for maximum throughput and accessibility
6. Riders are transported to designated shelters or safe zones
7. Vehicle capacity is optimized for emergency conditions (higher occupancy)
8. Continuous coordination with emergency management systems
9. Priority is given to vulnerable populations and critical areas
10. System provides real-time evacuation metrics to authorities

**Variants / Edge Cases:**
- Infrastructure damage: Alternative routing and access strategies
- Communications degradation: Autonomous operation with last-known directives
- Medical emergency during transport: First responder coordination
- Shelter capacity issues: Dynamic redistribution to alternative locations
- Fuel/energy constraints: Resource optimization and priority allocation

## Performance & Integration

**KPIs:**
- **P0 (Must have):**
  - Evacuation throughput: Maximum persons moved per hour
  - Response time: ≤10 minutes from activation to first pickups
  - Completion rate: ≥99% of evacuation requests fulfilled
  - Authority compliance: 100% adherence to emergency directives
- **P1 (Should have):**
  - Resource efficiency: Optimal vehicle distribution across evacuation zones
  - Vulnerable population priority: ≥98% of accessibility needs met
  - Coordination effectiveness: Real-time data sharing with emergency systems
  - Resilience: Continued operation under degraded infrastructure conditions

**Dependencies:**
- **Services:**
  - `emergency-service`: Evacuation coordination and authority integration
  - `dispatch`: Emergency-optimized vehicle assignment
  - `routing`: Evacuation route planning and real-time adaptation
  - `policy-engine`: Emergency protocols and override rules
  - `alerts-incident`: Emergency notification and status reporting
- **Rules:**
  - `rules/odd/ride-hail/emergency_evacuation.yaml`: Emergency operation parameters
  - `rules/policy/ride-hail/evacuation_priority.yaml`: Vulnerable population protocols
  - `rules/policy/safety/emergency_capacity.yaml`: Modified capacity guidelines

- **External Systems:**
  - Emergency Management System: Evacuation coordination
  - Traffic Management System: Emergency route status
  - Shelter Management System: Capacity and location data

**Risks & Mitigations:**
- **Infrastructure failure:**
  - Impact: High
  - Mitigation: Alternative routing, offline maps, last-mile walking guidance, coordination with authorities
- **Communications breakdown:**
  - Impact: High
  - Mitigation: Local decision making, mesh networking, preset evacuation protocols, autonomous operation
- **Panic and non-compliance:**
  - Impact: Medium
  - Mitigation: Clear communication, authority presence integration, simplified rider interaction
- **Resource limitations:**
  - Impact: High
  - Mitigation: Priority-based allocation, higher occupancy configuration, energy reserve management

## Validation & Deployment

**Acceptance / Test Hooks:**
- **Simulation Scenarios:**
  - `ride-hail/emergency/mass_evacuation.json`: Large-scale movement simulation
  - `ride-hail/emergency/infrastructure_damage.json`: Operation with limited access
  - `ride-hail/emergency/vulnerable_population.json`: Accessibility-focused evacuation
- **Logs/Telemetry:**
  - Evacuation metrics: throughput, completion rate, time to safety
  - Coordination metrics: authority directive compliance, information sharing
  - Operational metrics: vehicle utilization, route efficiency, energy management
- **Gates:**
  - Emergency management authority approval
  - Evacuation drill performance validation
  - Resilience testing under degraded conditions

**Rollout Plan:**
- **Phase 1:** Limited evacuation capability with emergency management oversight
- **Phase 2:** Integration with city emergency systems and evacuation plans
- **Phase 3:** Full-scale evacuation capability with multi-agency coordination
