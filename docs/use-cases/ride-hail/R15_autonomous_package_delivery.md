## Use Case Definition

**Actors:**
- Primary: Package Senders, Recipients, Fleet Operations
- Supporting: Merchants, Logistics Partners, Building Management

**Trip Type:** PACKAGE_DELIVERY_RUN

**ODD (Operational Design Domain):**
- Geographic: Urban and suburban areas, commercial and residential zones
- Environmental: All weather conditions, temperature range -20°C to 45°C
- Time: Extended operating hours with scheduled and on-demand capability
- Communications: Urban network with reliable coverage
- Other: Operation with specialized package handling equipment and secure storage systems

**Trigger:**
Package delivery request, scheduled distribution, or multi-stop delivery route

**Nominal Flow:**
1. System receives package delivery mission with item details and recipient information
2. Vehicle selection based on package characteristics and capacity requirements
3. Vehicle is equipped with appropriate secure storage and delivery verification tools
4. Route planning incorporates optimal delivery sequence and access considerations
5. Navigation to pickup location with precise positioning for efficient loading
6. Package loading with secure storage and inventory verification
7. Multi-stop navigation with optimal routing and delivery timing
8. Arrival notification to recipient with delivery instructions
9. Package retrieval verification with secure access protocols
10. Delivery confirmation with documentation and chain of custody verification

**Variants / Edge Cases:**
- Recipient unavailable: Secure alternative delivery options and reattempt scheduling
- Access restrictions: Building entry protocols and coordination with management
- Signature requirements: Identity verification and electronic documentation
- Special handling: Temperature control, orientation preservation, fragility management
- Return handling: Package rejection protocols and return authorization

## Performance & Integration

**KPIs:**
- **P0 (Must have):**
  - Delivery success rate: ≥98% first-attempt completion
  - Package security: Zero loss or damage incidents
  - Verification accuracy: 100% correct package to recipient matching
  - Documentation completeness: Full chain of custody records
- **P1 (Should have):**
  - Delivery efficiency: ≥12 packages per hour in urban environments
