### Context

AtlasMesh Fleet OS aims to operate across multiple vehicle classes and models without requiring code forks or custom implementations per vehicle. This requires a clear architecture that separates vehicle-specific concerns from core platform capabilities.

#### Problem Statement

Supporting multiple vehicle types traditionally requires significant customization, leading to:
1. Code forks and maintenance overhead
2. Inconsistent behavior across vehicle types
3. Lengthy onboarding time for new vehicles
4. Difficulty maintaining safety certifications across variants
5. Increased testing matrix complexity

#### Market & Business Drivers

1. Customers demand multi-vehicle fleet support (heterogeneous fleets)
2. Vehicle OEMs frequently update models and control interfaces
3. Cross-sector operations require different vehicle classes
4. Retrofit market demands flexibility across vehicle ages and types
5. TCO improvements require standardized maintenance and operations

### Decision

We will implement a **vehicle-agnostic architecture** with the following key components:

1. **Vehicle Profile System** - A configuration-driven approach where each supported vehicle has a profile defining:
   - Physical characteristics (mass, wheelbase, CG height, etc.)
   - Actuation parameters (brake curves, steering ratio, etc.)
   - Sensor placement and calibration
   - Control limits (max acceleration, jerk, lateral forces)

2. **Drive-by-Wire Abstraction Layer** - A hardware abstraction layer that:
   - Provides a unified API for vehicle control
   - Handles protocol translation (CAN/J1939/FlexRay)
   - Manages redundancy and failover for safety-critical systems
   - Enforces latency budgets (≤20ms link, ≤80ms end-to-end)

3. **Safety Bundle Requirements** - Each supported vehicle must have:
   - HARA/FMEA documentation
   - Stopping distance certification
   - HiL test results
   - Formal safety case deltas

4. **Conformance Testing Framework** - Automated validation that:
   - Verifies profile accuracy through closed-course testing
   - Validates control performance across operating conditions
   - Tests degraded mode behaviors

### Guardrails

| Guardrail | Description | Enforcement Mechanism | Violation Response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Variant Budget** | No more than 5% core code delta and 25% test-time delta per release for vehicle-specific code | Static code analysis in CI pipeline; test runtime metrics | PR rejection; architecture review; refactoring requirement |
| **No Core Forks** | Vehicle differences must be expressed through configuration, not code forks | Code structure validation; config schema enforcement | PR rejection; architecture review; design pattern guidance |
| **Safety Case Updates** | Each new vehicle requires safety case deltas and certification | Release gate checks for safety artifacts; compliance validation | Release block; safety review board escalation |
| **Mandatory Testing** | HiL and closed-course validation for each supported vehicle class | Test coverage reports; validation checklist enforcement | Release block; test plan review; validation requirement |

### KPIs/SLOs

| KPI/SLO | Description | Target | Measurement Method | Reporting Frequency | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Availability** | Percentage of time vehicles are operational and mission-capable | ≥99.0% across ≥3 vehicle classes | (Operational hours - Downtime) / Scheduled hours | Daily, Weekly rollup | Operations Lead |
| **Assist Rate** | Number of human interventions required per distance traveled | ≤2 per 1,000 km | Count of assist events / Distance traveled | Daily, Weekly trend | Safety Lead |
| **Control Accuracy** | Deviation from expected behavior for critical maneuvers | Controlled stop distance within ±5% of profile spec | Closed-course testing; Telemetry analysis | Per release, Monthly validation | Vehicle Integration Lead |
| **Telemetry Completeness** | Percentage of expected telemetry data successfully captured | Gap <0.5% per 24h | (Received data points / Expected data points) | Daily | Data Platform Lead |
| **Onboarding Efficiency** | Time required to integrate new vehicle models | ≤14 days for supported classes | Project tracking from start to production-ready | Per vehicle onboarding | Integration Team Lead |
| **Profile Accuracy** | Correlation between profile parameters and actual behavior | ≥95% match on critical parameters | Validation testing; Telemetry comparison | Per profile version | Vehicle Dynamics Lead |

### Implementation Paths

| Component | Path | Description | Responsible Team | Dependencies |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Vehicle Profiles** | `/configs/vehicles/*` | YAML profiles defining physical and operational characteristics of each supported vehicle | Vehicle Integration | Vehicle specifications; Calibration data |
| **ODD Limits** | `/rules/odd/vehicle_limits.rego` | Policy rules defining operational design domain limits specific to vehicle classes | Safety & Compliance | ODD framework; Policy engine |
| **Simulation Scenarios** | `/sim/scenario-bank/vehicle/*` | Simulation scenarios for validating vehicle-specific behavior | Simulation | Scenario framework; Vehicle dynamics models |
| **HAL Implementation** | `/edge/vehicle-agent/hal/*` | Hardware abstraction layer implementing the vehicle-agnostic interface | Edge Platform | Vehicle interfaces; Control systems |

| **Safety Case Generator** | `/compliance/safety-case/vehicle/*` | Tools for generating vehicle-specific safety case artifacts | Safety & Compliance | Safety framework; Evidence collection |

#### Integration Points

1. **Control Systems** - The HAL integrates with vehicle control systems via standardized interfaces
2. **Perception System** - Vehicle profiles inform perception parameters (sensor placement, field of view)
3. **Planning & Control** - Vehicle dynamics parameters feed into motion planning and control algorithms
4. **Diagnostics** - Vehicle-specific diagnostic codes and health monitoring
5. **OTA Updates** - Vehicle-specific firmware and configuration management

#### Negative

| Consequence | Description | Mitigation Strategy | Residual Risk |

### Kill-Switch Criteria

If any of the following occur, we will pause new vehicle onboarding and revert to Tier-A vehicles only:
1. ≥2 critical incidents attributable to profile gaps in 2 quarters
2. >25% schedule slip due to vehicle variance

### Alternatives Considered

| Alternative | Description | Pros | Cons | Why Rejected |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Vehicle-specific code branches** | Maintain separate code branches for each vehicle type | Perfect optimization for each vehicle; Direct mapping to OEM specs | Maintenance burden; Code divergence; Exponential testing matrix | Unsustainable maintenance burden; High risk of inconsistent behavior |
| **Fully generic approach without profiles** | Single codebase with runtime parameter adjustment | Maximum code reuse; Simplified maintenance | Safety concerns with generic parameters; Performance limitations; Difficult certification | Cannot guarantee safety properties across diverse vehicle dynamics |
| **OEM-provided control systems only** | Rely on OEM interfaces and control systems | Leverages OEM expertise; Simplified integration | Vendor lock-in; Inconsistent capabilities; Limited retrofit options | Strategic constraint; Limits market reach; Inconsistent feature set |

### Compliance & Regulatory Considerations

1. **ISO 26262 (Functional Safety)**: Each vehicle profile requires specific HARA/FMEA documentation and safety case deltas
2. **SOTIF (ISO 21448)**: Performance boundary conditions must be defined per vehicle class
3. **UNECE R155/R156**: Cybersecurity and OTA updates must account for vehicle-specific parameters
4. **Regional Certifications**: Profile-specific evidence bundles support regional type approvals

### Monitoring & Metrics

| Metric | Description | Target | Warning Threshold | Critical Threshold | Data Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Profile Accuracy | Deviation between expected and actual vehicle behavior | <3% | 3-5% | >5% | Telemetry comparison |
