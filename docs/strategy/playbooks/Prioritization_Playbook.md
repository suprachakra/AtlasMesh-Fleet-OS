## 1. Prioritization Framework

### 1.1 Prioritization Principles
- **Evidence-based**: Use data to support decisions
- **Value-driven**: Focus on business and user value
- **Risk-aware**: Consider technical and business risks
- **Resource-conscious**: Account for team capacity and constraints
- **Strategic alignment**: Ensure alignment with company goals

### 1.2 Prioritization Levels
1. **Strategic Level**: Company objectives and OKRs
2. **Portfolio Level**: Product lines and major initiatives
3. **Product Level**: Features and capabilities
4. **Sprint Level**: User stories and tasks

---

## 2. Prioritization Methods

### 2.1 RICE Scoring
**Purpose**: Score features based on Reach, Impact, Confidence and Effort

#### RICE Formula
```
RICE Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort
```

#### Scoring Guidelines
| Factor | Scale | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Reach** | 1-10 | How many users will this affect? |
| **Impact** | 1-10 | How much will this impact each user? |
| **Confidence** | 0.5-1.0 | How confident are we in our estimates? |
| **Effort** | 1-10 | How much effort will this require? |

#### RICE Scoring Template
| Feature | Reach | Impact | Confidence | Effort | RICE Score | Rank |
|---------|-------|--------|------------|--------|------------|------|
| [Feature 1] | [Score] | [Score] | [Score] | [Score] | [Score] | [Rank] |
| [Feature 2] | [Score] | [Score] | [Score] | [Score] | [Score] | [Rank] |

### 2.2 Value vs Effort Matrix
**Purpose**: Visual prioritization based on value and effort

#### Matrix Quadrants
- **Quick Wins** (High Value, Low Effort): Do first
- **Major Projects** (High Value, High Effort): Plan carefully
- **Fill-ins** (Low Value, Low Effort): Do when time allows
- **Questionable** (Low Value, High Effort): Avoid

#### Value vs Effort Template
| Feature | Value Score | Effort Score | Quadrant | Priority |
|---------|-------------|--------------|----------|----------|
| [Feature 1] | [Score] | [Score] | [Quadrant] | [Priority] |
| [Feature 2] | [Score] | [Score] | [Quadrant] | [Priority] |

### 2.3 Kano Model
**Purpose**: Categorize features by user satisfaction impact

#### Kano Categories
- **Must-Have**: Basic requirements, users expect these
- **Performance**: More is better, linear satisfaction
- **Delighters**: Unexpected features that create delight

#### Kano Analysis Template
| Feature | Must-Have | Performance | Delighter | Category | Priority |
|---------|-----------|-------------|-----------|----------|----------|
| [Feature 1] | [Score] | [Score] | [Score] | [Category] | [Priority] |
| [Feature 2] | [Score] | [Score] | [Score] | [Category] | [Priority] |
