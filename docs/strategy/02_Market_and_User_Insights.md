## 3) Market Sizing (methodology & validation)

**TAM Calculation Methodology**:
1. **Bottom-up vehicle count**: Sector-specific asset databases × retrofit eligibility % × average unit economics
2. **Top-down budget analysis**: Industry autonomy spending forecasts × addressable share % × regional focus
3. **Cross-validation**: Market research triangulation with 3+ independent sources

**Data Sources & Validation**:
- **Mining**: Global Mining Data (verified against annual reports of top 20 miners)
- **Defense**: Jane's Defense + national defense budgets (validated with procurement forecasts)
- **Logistics**: Gartner Supply Chain + port TEU statistics (cross-checked with equipment OEMs)
- **Ride-hail**: Regional mobility reports + TNC fleet data (validated with regulatory filings)

**Confidence Levels**:
- **High confidence**: Mining, Ports (±15% margin of error)
- **Medium confidence**: Defense, Logistics (±25% margin of error)
- **Lower confidence**: Ride-hail (±35% margin of error, requires pilot validation)

**Validation Plan**:
- Quarterly market size reassessment with new data inputs
- Customer advisory board review of assumptions
- Pilot economics validation against projections
- Regional expansion feasibility studies

**TAM formula (per sector)**
`Vehicles_in_scope × (HW_kit_price + annual_SW + integration/pro_services)`
**SAM** = TAM × `% regions with compatible regulations & infra`
**SOM (3 yr)** = SAM × `target share by segment`

> Action: `docs/Strategy/09_Finance_and_Cost_Model.md` includes a calculator; CI will recompute with linked datasets.

### 3.1 Bottom-up method (per sector / region)

**Units in ODD × Adoption% × Attach rate × ASP = SAM revenue.**

* **Units in ODD**: counted assets that can legally & operationally run L4 in our target ODD (e.g., *mine haul trucks on private roads*).
* **Adoption%**: phased curve (Year 1 pilot 1–3%; Year 3 10–20%; Year 5 25–40% private/controlled sites).
* **Attach rate**: fraction using both **CoreX Kit** *and* **AtlasMesh** (some may use FMS only).
* **ASP** (blended, 3-yr TCV): **CoreX** kit \$85–250k (vehicle class) + **AtlasMesh** \$250–800/vehicle/mo + site fees.
