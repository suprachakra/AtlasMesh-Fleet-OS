* **Platform-agnostic.** Cloud-neutral; deploy on customer cloud or ours; k8s-native; mTLS/OIDC; **policy-as-code**.
* **Sector-agnostic.** **Rules/overlays** for ODD, regulatory, dispatch, HMI; no forks.

**Extreme-weather advantage.**

* Heat-aware routing & charge/fuel scheduling, dust-robust perception configs, **weather fusion** with **freshness vs. credibility** controls.
* **Comms-tolerant autonomy** (store-and-forward, opportunistic sync, SAT backup), **graceful degradation** to ODD-safe behaviors.

**Operational truth.** **Self-auditing**: every deployment auto-produces safety & compliance evidence; **red/amber gates** block releases that regress safety/CSAT/assist KPIs or violate ODD.

---

### 4) Scope, non-goals, boundaries

**In-scope.** L4 geofenced autonomy; retrofit kits; Fleet OS; tele-assist **Q&A** (no joystick drive); safety case; ops tooling; integrations (WMS/TOS/ERP/V2X); rider/mission UX.

**Out-of-scope (non-goals).**

* Selling complete vehicles; **Level-5** everywhere; lethal functionality; driver-takeover via remote driving; uncontrolled public-road beta.
* **Single-tenant forks** (all tenant variance via configs/policy only).
* Unsupported climates without thermal spec conformance.

**Boundary Conditions**:
- **Vehicle Classes**: Support vehicles ≤26,000 kg GVWR; wheelbase 2.5-8.5m; max 3 articulation points
- **ODD Limits**: Max operational speed 80 km/h; visibility ≥10m; max grade 15%; temperature -40°C to +65°C
- **Assist Budget**: ≤2/1,000 km; max 45-min offline operation; max 5% variant budget
- **Regulatory**: No deployment without jurisdiction pack; no operation without safety case
- **Economic**: No custom development without ROI validation; no sector expansion without proven economics

**Decision Framework**: Any scope expansion requires:
1. Strategic alignment assessment
2. Variant budget impact analysis
3. Safety case extension validation
4. Economic model validation
5. Executive approval with documented rationale

**Enforcement.** ADR: `ADR/00xx-non-goals.md` + toggles in `rules/odd/*` and `rules/policy/*`. Sales playbooks reject out-of-scope RFPs.

---

### 5) ODD (Operational Design Domain) definition

**Axes.** Geography (tiles), road classes, weather (heat/dust/wind/visibility), time of day, traffic density, comms bands, **GNSS integrity**, legal constraints.

**ODD contract.** Machine-readable in `rules/odd/`, referenced by dispatch/routing; **ODD guard** halts or re-plans when sensors, weather, or comms breach thresholds (with tele-assist budget).

**Examples.**

* **Defense corridor:** paved/unpaved, GNSS degraded allowed with SLAM confidence ≥X, SAT fallback required, convoy platooning ≤Y gap.
* **Mine haul:** fixed route graph, dust visibility ≥ Vmin, slope ≤ Smax, heat derate curve loaded from vehicle profile.
* **Ride-hail district:** municipal permit zone; work-zone cones → consult tele-assist; rider pickup/ADA flows.

---

### 6) Users & stakeholders (personas)

* **Dispatcher (Ops).** Needs SLA-tight assignment, incident triage.
* **Rider Support (RH).** Needs live trip context, safe-stop flows, UX scripts.
* **Depot/Mine Tech.** Needs health, firmware staging, PdM tickets, SIM/telemetry status.
* **Mission Commander (Def).** Needs convoy status, ROE-compliant controls, audit trail.
* **Port/Yard Supervisor (Log).** Needs yard map, queue control, crane sync.
* **Compliance/Safety.** Needs safety case evidence, audit bundles.
* **CISO.** Needs SBOMs, attestation, secrets posture, incident runbooks.

**RACI** in `docs/strategy/04_Product_and_Marketplace_Strategy.md`. Objection library in Marketing Plan.

---

### 7) Top-line success metrics & OKR linkage

**North-star metric families** (registered & alert-backed):

* **Safety:** zero harm; assists/1k km; safe-stops/10k km; disengagement taxonomy.
* **Reliability:** fleet availability; mission completion; ODD conformance rate.
* **Economic:** cost/ton-km (mining/logistics); cost/ride (ride-hail); ROI months to payback.
* **Operational:** P95 dispatch latency; on-time arrival; charger queue time; energy $/km.
* **Experience (ride-hail):** CSAT, cancellation rate, pickup ETA P95, accessibility completion.

**OKR examples (Yr-1).**

* **O:** Demonstrate sector-agnostic scale in ME.

  * **KR1:** Deploy ≥3 sectors, ≥2 countries, ≥250 vehicles under one Fleet OS.
  * **KR2:** Achieve **≤0.3 assists/1k km** across all sectors' ODDs for 90-day period.
  * **KR3:** Positive ROI (<18 months) evidenced for first 2 customers per sector.

### 9) Design principles & hard trade-offs (with policies)

1. **Provenance vs. Freshness.**
   **Policy:** score incoming geo/weather data on `credibility × freshness`; workflows prefer **credible** unless freshness surpasses threshold *and* risk score < policy limit. All decisions logged.

2. **Autonomy vs. Assist.**
   **Policy:** per-sector assist budget (time & frequency). Exceeding budget → **auto rollback** last build + red gate.

3. **Edge vs. Cloud.**
   **Policy:** safety-critical logic on edge; cloud only for planning/analytics. Cloud outage must **not** reduce minimal safe behavior.

4. **Retrofit vs. Purpose-built.**
   **Policy:** default retrofit; allow purpose-built only when per-km TCO proves ≥15% improvement at scale and ADR approves.

5. **Security vs. Operability.**
   **Policy:** all comms mTLS + PKI; OTA signed and staged; no exceptions. Air-gapped workflows available for defense tenants.

6. **Uniformity vs. Customization.**
   **Policy:** customer specifics expressed **exclusively** in `configs/` + `rules/` overlays; forks forbidden by CI.

---

### 10) Ethics & guardrails

* **Do-no-harm:** geofences and ROE encoded; no lethal payload control.
* **Privacy-by-default:** least data; retention limits; PII masking on edge; audit trails.
* **Transparency:** incident explainers; rider/mission log redaction rules; **model cards** for deployed ML.
* **Fair access:** accessibility & language/RTL support; price fairness policies in ride-hail.

Compliance hooks live in `docs/safety/` and `compliance/`.

---

### 11) Regulatory posture (adaptive)

* **Safety case automation:** evidence bundles **auto-generated** per release (`compliance/audit-bundles/`).
* **Jurisdiction overlays:** local speed, lane rules, AV permits in `rules/regulatory/*`.
* **Change control:** any rule change → RFC + ADR + sim gate pass required.
* **Law-enforcement protocols:** standardized interactions; safe-stop zones; contact trees.

---

### Product Management Community of Practice (PM CoP)

#### Charter

**Purpose**: Standardize product craft; improve speed/quality; ensure safety/compliance by design across all vehicle/sector/platform dimensions.

**Scope**: All PRDs, policies, pricing, and user-facing changes across AtlasMesh Fleet OS.

**Guardrails**:
- Evidence-based decisions (no PRD without evidence pack)
- Traceability enforcement (OKR→Epic→FR/NFR→Tests→SLIs→Evidence)
- Variant budget adherence (≤5% code delta, ≤25% test delta)
- No unreviewed sector forks or platform-specific code
- Safety/compliance gates are non-negotiable

#### Organizational Structure

**CoP Roles**:
- **Chair** (rotating quarterly): Senior PM; owns agenda & outcomes
- **Chapter Leads**: Sector (Defense/Mining/Logistics/Ride-hail), Platform, Edge/Vehicle, Data/AI, Safety/Compliance
- **Steering Group**: VP Product, VP Engineering, Safety Lead, Design Director, CS/GTM Lead (monthly decisions)
- **Working Groups** (time-boxed): Pricing & Packaging, Policy/Reg UX, Evidence UX, Variant Budget Governance

**Decision Model**: **DACI** (Driver-Approver-Contributors-Informed) for all cross-team product decisions; integrated with CCB for safety-impacting changes.

#### Operating Cadence

- **Weekly (45 min)**: Backlog Intake & Prioritization (shared board, single funnel)
- **Bi-weekly (60 min)**: Discovery Reviews (opportunity canvases, evidence packs)
- **Monthly (90 min)**: Roadmap & Risk Council (variant budget, dependencies, kill-switches)
- **Monthly (60 min)**: Craft Review (PRD/UX critique, heuristics, learnings)
- **Quarterly (half-day)**: Strategy/OKR alignment + Outcome Quality reviews
- **Ad-hoc (≤45 min)**: PM+Design+Eng triads for Definition of Ready enforcement

**Async-First**: All docs shared 48h prior; live time reserved for decisions only.

#### Ground Rules (10 Non-Negotiables)

1. **Evidence before opinion** - No PRD without minimal evidence pack (5-7 interviews, telemetry, sim impact, policy review)
2. **Traceability is mandatory** - Every FR/NFR maps to OKRs, tests, SLIs, and evidence
3. **Agnostic by contract** - Profiles, packs, policies—not forks
4. **Variant budget is a product constraint** - PMs manage it like scope/time/cost
5. **Rollout ≠ release** - Flags, canaries, pilots, and predefined rollback paths mandatory
6. **Safety & compliance are features** - They have owners, SLIs, and gates
7. **Design is operational** - UI must perform under stress and meet accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA)
8. **Post-launch learning is required** - 30-day OQ review closes the loop
9. **Asynchronous excellence** - Comment in docs, not in meetings
10. **Respect the clock** - Timeboxed reviews; decisions captured in DACI log

#### Success Metrics (Quarterly Scorecard)

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Evidence coverage | ≥90% epics with evidence pack |
| Traceability completeness | 100% for shipped features |
| Variant budget compliance | 0 breaches per quarter |
| Roadmap accuracy | ≥80% within ±1 sprint |
| Outcome hit rate | ≥70% KRs achieved |
| Accessibility pass rate | 100% on P0 flows |
| Escaped defects (P0/P1) | ↓ QoQ |
| Operator SUS | ≥80 |

#### Cross-Department Integration

**Hardwired Reviews** (required before approval):
- **Safety/Compliance**: Policy changes, autonomy behavior, evidence generation
- **Design System**: All UI changes must use design tokens; WCAG 2.2 AA compliance
- **Data/AI**: Features using models require model cards and drift plans
- **QA/Test**: BDD specs, sim/twin scenarios, perf & soak tests for P0 paths
- **CS/Support**: Runbooks and support macros before GA

**Variant Budget Governance**:
- PMs own the estimate during planning
- CoP verifies monthly actuals vs CI measurements
- Budget exceeded → CCB review or carve-out (overlay/adapter) decision
- Monthly celebration of teams that reduce variant cost

#### Framework Flow

**Intake → Discovery → Definition → Delivery → Evidence**

1. **Intake**: Single form with auto-labels (Sector, Safety Tier, Variant Budget)
2. **Discovery**: Time-boxed (1-3 weeks); produce Opportunity Canvas + Evidence Pack
3. **Definition**: Evidence-First PRD, DoR checklist, triad sign-off (PM+Design+Eng) + Safety if policy-touching
4. **Delivery**: Feature flags, launch types (canary/pilot/GA), gate checks (policy perf, OTA integrity, audit completeness)
5. **Evidence**: Compare SLIs vs targets; 30-day OQ review; learnings fed back into playbooks

#### Documentation & Tooling

**Single Source of Truth**: `/docs/strategy/` and `/docs/Technical/` for all PM artifacts (versioned, reviewable, traceable)

**Templates & Playbooks**: See `docs/strategy/templates/` and `docs/strategy/playbooks/`

**DACI Decision Log**: See `docs/strategy/Decision_Log_DACI.md`

**Automation**: CI guards for DoR/DoD, traceability, variant budget, SLI instrumentation

### Bottom line
It is **deliberately engineered to leave no gaps**: every promise in this Vision & Problem Statement is backed by a measurable KPI, a policy, an ODD rule, or an automated gate. If it's not encoded, it doesn't ship. The **PM Community of Practice** ensures this discipline is maintained across all product streams through evidence-first decisions, enforced traceability, and continuous outcome measurement. This ensures strategic clarity, technical integrity, safety, and scalability across **defense, mining, logistics, and ride-hailing**—under the harsh realities of the Middle East and beyond.
