**What we’re building (for whom, where it wins).**  
AtlasMesh Fleet OS is the **agnostic operating system for Level-4 autonomous fleets** across **defense, mining, logistics, and ride-hail**. It retrofits mixed vehicles and orchestrates missions in **50–60 °C heat, dust, GNSS degradation, and intermittent comms**, while **automating regulatory evidence**. One platform, policy overlays—**weeks to deploy**, **evidence-ready by default**, and **no vendor lock-in**.

## Who & Where it Wins
| Sector | Prime ODD (ME focus) | Flagship Use Cases |
|---|---|---|
| Defense | GNSS-degraded corridors; base/border logistics | Convoy resupply, perimeter patrol, route assurance |
| Mining | Open-pit haul; stockyards | Haul, water carts, graders, shift change |
| Logistics | Ports, yards, DC shuttles | Yard tractors, gate-to-dock, crane sync |
| Ride-hail | Geofenced districts (permitted) | Robotaxi/shuttle ops room, incident flows |

## Five Ways We Create Outsized Value
- **98.5%+ mission uptime** in harsh ODDs via graceful degradation & offline autonomy.  
- **≤0.3 assists / 1,000 km** using policy-driven assist budgets & scenario mining.  
- **2–8 week integrations** through certified adapters (WMS/TOS/ERP/map/weather).  
- **3–6 month approvals** with automated evidence bundles & jurisdiction packs.  
- **≤18-month ROI** on cost/ton (mining), cycle time (ports), ETA/CSAT (ride-hail).

## Strategic Imperatives
| Imperative | Why it Matters | Success Signal |
|---|---|---|
| **Agnostic-by-Design** (vehicle/sensor/map/cloud/sector) | Eliminates lock-in; scales cross-sector | Same codebase runs 4 sectors; hot-swap ≥2 vendors per stack with no forks |
| **Harsh-Environment Excellence** | Operate when others suspend | Uptime ≥98.5% at ≥50 °C & dust events; ≤1 safe-stop/10k km during storms |
| **Evidence-First Operations** | Speeds permits; builds regulator trust | 100% releases ship complete safety bundle; ≥2 regulator sign-offs/year |
| **Rapid, Repeatable Deployment** | Time-to-value drives wins & margins | Site cutover ≤14 days; vehicle install ≤8 h; adapters pass contract tests |

## North-Star KPIs (tracked daily)
- **Availability** = Mission-capable hours / Scheduled hours → **target ≥99.0%** (Yr-1).  
- **Assist rate** = Assists / 1,000 km → **target ≤0.5** (Yr-1) → **≤0.3** (Yr-2).  
- **Time-to-Deploy** = Contract-signed → First mission → **target ≤8 weeks**.  
- **Audit readiness** = % releases with complete evidence bundle → **target 100%**.  
- **Economic lift** = Δ(cost/ton, cycle time, ETA P95, CSAT) vs baseline → **sector-specific targets**.

## Roadmap (Now / Next / Later)
| Period | What We Ship | For Whom | Proof of Done |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Now (0–90 days)** | Retrofit kit SKUs (Rugged/Industrial), Control Center v1 (Arabic/RTL), Adapter SDK v1 (TOS/WMS), Jurisdiction Packs v1 (UAE/KSA) | Mining, Ports, Defense | 3 pilots live (mine, port, base); ≤8 h install; ≥97% uptime (30 days); first evidence bundle accepted |
| **Next (90–270 days)** | Q&A Tele-assist SLA, PdM v1, Energy Optimizer, Map/Weather Fusion v1, Twin-Gated CI, On-prem option | Mining, Ports, Ride-hail, Defense | ≤0.7 assists/1k km rolling; cutover ≤14 days; 2 regulator sign-offs; cost/ton −8% at lighthouse |
| **Later (270–540 days)** | Multi-tenant scaling (250+ vehicles), Adapter Marketplace (10+ certified), Jurisdiction Packs v2, Advanced analytics | All sectors | ≤0.3 assists/1k km across 3 sites; uptime ≥99.3%; 3 case studies with KPI deltas |
