## Risk & Governance

## 1. Risk Management Framework

AtlasMesh Fleet OS adopts a comprehensive risk management framework that spans technical, operational, commercial, and compliance domains. This framework ensures risks are systematically identified, assessed, mitigated, and monitored throughout the product lifecycle.

### 1.1. Risk Categories

| Category | Description | Examples | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Safety & Technical** | Risks affecting safe operation of autonomous systems | Perception failures, control faults, software defects | Safety & Engineering |
| **Operational** | Risks affecting service delivery and fleet operations | Deployment delays, assist overload, site readiness | Operations |
| **Commercial** | Risks affecting business model and customer relationships | Cost overruns, contract disputes, competitor actions | Business & Finance |
| **Compliance** | Risks related to regulatory requirements and standards | Permit denials, regulatory changes, audit failures | Legal & Compliance |
| **Security** | Risks related to cybersecurity and data protection | Breaches, unauthorized access, data leaks | Security |
| **Strategic** | Risks affecting long-term vision and market position | Market shifts, technology obsolescence, talent gaps | Executive Team |

### 1.2) Risk Assessment Matrix

All identified risks are evaluated using the following matrix:

| Impact↓ / Likelihood→ | Rare (1) | Unlikely (2) | Possible (3) | Likely (4) | Almost Certain (5) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Catastrophic (5)** | Medium (5) | High (10) | High (15) | Extreme (20) | Extreme (25) |
| **Major (4)** | Medium (4) | Medium (8) | High (12) | High (16) | Extreme (20) |
| **Moderate (3)** | Low (3) | Medium (6) | Medium (9) | High (12) | High (15) |
| **Minor (2)** | Low (2) | Low (4) | Medium (6) | Medium (8) | High (10) |
| **Insignificant (1)** | Low (1) | Low (2) | Low (3) | Medium (4) | Medium (5) |

**Response Requirements:**
- **Extreme (17-25)**: Immediate executive attention; mitigation plan required within 48 hours
- **High (10-16)**: Weekly review; mitigation plan required within 1 week
- **Medium (5-9)**: Monthly review; documented control measures
