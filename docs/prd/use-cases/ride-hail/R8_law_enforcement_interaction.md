# R8 — Law Enforcement Interaction

## Basic Information

**ID:** R8  
**Name:** Law Enforcement Interaction  
**Sector:** Ride-hail  
**Status:** Approved  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-14  
**Owner:** Ride-hail Sector Lead

## Use Case Definition

**Actors:**
- Primary: Law Enforcement Officers, Fleet Operations Center
- Supporting: Riders, Safety Team, Legal/Compliance Department

**Trip Type:** All trip types (cross-cutting)

**ODD (Operational Design Domain):**
- Geographic: All operational areas
- Environmental: All standard operating conditions
- Time: 24/7 operations
- Communications: Reliable connection to operations center preferred but not required
- Other: Clear external indicators and interaction protocols

**Trigger:**
Law enforcement stop request, emergency vehicle interaction, or incident response

**Nominal Flow:**
1. System detects law enforcement stop request through visual/auditory cues or direct communication
2. Vehicle acknowledges detection with external indicators and begins safe stop procedure
3. System notifies operations center with location, officer information, and context
4. Vehicle selects optimal stopping location considering safety and traffic impact
5. External displays provide clear status information to approaching officers
6. Digital identification and vehicle information is made available through secure interface
7. Operations center establishes communication with law enforcement if needed
8. System maintains comprehensive recording of interaction with privacy safeguards
9. Upon completion, vehicle requests permission to resume operations
10. Incident is documented with appropriate follow-up actions

**Variants / Edge Cases:**
- Emergency vehicle yielding: Priority movement to clear path
- Incident scene management: Coordination with first responders
- Multiple officer interaction: Unified response protocol
- Communications failure: Autonomous completion of interaction
- Rider concerns: Clear communication and support channels

## Performance & Integration

**KPIs:**
- **P0 (Must have):**
  - Detection accuracy: ≥99.5% of legitimate stop requests
  - Response time: ≤5 seconds from detection to acknowledgment
  - Compliance rating: ≥98% officer satisfaction with interaction
  - Documentation completeness: 100% of interactions properly recorded
- **P1 (Should have):**
  - False positive rate: ≤0.1% incorrect stop initiations
  - Operations center notification: ≤10 seconds from detection
  - Interaction duration: -20% vs. industry average
  - Rider experience: ≥4.7/5.0 CSAT during law enforcement interactions

**Dependencies:**
- **Services:**
  - `safety-service`: Law enforcement detection and response
  - `rider-ux`: Rider communication during interactions
  - `fleet-health`: Vehicle status and operation monitoring
  - `policy-engine`: Jurisdiction-specific interaction protocols
  - `alerts-incident`: Operations center notification and coordination
- **Rules:**
  - `rules/odd/ride-hail/law_enforcement.yaml`: Interaction parameters
  - `rules/policy/ride-hail/emergency_response.yaml`: Response protocols by jurisdiction
  - `rules/policy/ride-hail/rider_communication.yaml`: Passenger information guidelines
  - `rules/policy/security/evidence_collection.yaml`: Recording and documentation requirements
- **External Systems:**
  - Safety Operations Center: Incident monitoring and response
  - Legal/Compliance System: Interaction documentation and follow-up
  - Law Enforcement Liaison Portal: Information sharing and coordination

**Risks & Mitigations:**
- **Missed detection:**
  - Impact: Critical
  - Mitigation: Multi-modal detection, conservative thresholds, officer education program
- **Inappropriate stop location:**
  - Impact: High
  - Mitigation: Safety-prioritized selection algorithm, traffic awareness, officer feedback
- **Rider anxiety:**
  - Impact: Medium
  - Mitigation: Clear in-vehicle communication, support access, transparent process
- **Privacy concerns:**
  - Impact: High
  - Mitigation: Selective recording, data minimization, access controls, retention policies

## Validation & Deployment

**Acceptance / Test Hooks:**
- **Simulation Scenarios:**
  - `ride-hail/law_enforcement/stop_detection.json`: Various officer approach methods
  - `ride-hail/law_enforcement/emergency_vehicle.json`: Yielding and coordination
  - `ride-hail/law_enforcement/rider_experience.json`: Communication and support
- **Logs/Telemetry:**
  - Interaction metrics: detection time, response time, completion time
  - Compliance metrics: protocol adherence, information provision, officer feedback
  - Experience metrics: rider feedback, anxiety indicators, support utilization
- **Gates:**
  - Detection performance validation with law enforcement partners
  - Protocol compliance verification with legal/regulatory review
  - Rider experience assessment with user testing

**Rollout Plan:**
- **Phase 1:** Basic stop detection and response capability
- **Phase 2:** Enhanced officer interaction with digital information access
- **Phase 3:** Full integration with jurisdiction-specific protocols and liaison programs
