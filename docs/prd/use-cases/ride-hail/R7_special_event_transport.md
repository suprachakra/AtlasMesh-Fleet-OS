## Basic Information

**ID:** R7  
**Name:** Special Event Transport  
**Sector:** Ride-hail  
**Status:** Approved  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-14  
**Owner:** Ride-hail Sector Lead

## Use Case Definition

**Actors:**
- Primary: Event Attendees, Event Organizers, Fleet Operations Manager
- Supporting: Venue Management, Traffic Authorities, City Event Coordinators

**Trip Type:** EVENT_RUN

**ODD (Operational Design Domain):**
- Geographic: Event venues, designated pickup/dropoff zones, approach corridors
- Environmental: Standard weather thresholds with event-specific considerations
- Time: Aligned with event schedules (pre-event, intermission, post-event)
- Communications: Urban LTE/5G with capacity planning for high-density areas
- Other: High-volume, synchronized operations with venue-specific constraints

**Trigger:**
Event schedule, venue coordination, or demand surge detection

**Nominal Flow:**
1. System ingests event data including location, timing, expected attendance, and venue constraints
2. Fleet positioning plan is generated to optimize pre-event vehicle availability
3. Designated pickup/dropoff zones are activated with virtual queuing and rider matching
4. Riders book trips with event-specific options (pre-paid parking shuttle, post-event guarantee)
5. System implements surge mitigation through batching and efficient zone management
6. Vehicles navigate to optimized approach routes with venue-specific access protocols
7. At venue, riders are efficiently loaded/unloaded at designated zones with minimal dwell time
8. Post-event, system implements wave-based dispatch to maximize throughput
9. Real-time coordination with venue and traffic authorities manages exceptional volume
10. System captures event performance metrics for continuous improvement

**Variants / Edge Cases:**
- Weather impact on outdoor events: Covered area prioritization, modified zone operations
- Event schedule changes: Dynamic replanning with priority communication
- Security incidents: Coordination with authorities, safe zone operations
- Multi-venue coordination: Cross-venue optimization for citywide events
- Post-event demand spike: Wave management, virtual queuing, rider communication

## Performance & Integration

**KPIs:**
- **P0 (Must have):**
  - Peak throughput: ≥120 rides/hour per designated zone
  - Wait time: P95 ≤15 minutes during peak surge
  - Rider satisfaction: CSAT ≥4.5/5.0 for event service
  - Venue coordination success: Zero access violations or complaints
- **P1 (Should have):**
  - Pre-booking rate: ≥60% of event rides
  - Zone efficiency: ≤45 seconds average dwell time per pickup/dropoff
  - Driver satisfaction: ≥4.6/5.0 for event operations
  - Traffic impact: -30% congestion vs. unmanaged operations

**Dependencies:**
- **Services:**
  - `dispatch`: High-volume batch processing and wave management
  - `routing`: Venue-specific navigation with access controls
  - `rider-ux`: Event-specific booking experience and virtual queuing
  - `policy-engine`: Event rules and venue coordination policies
  - `analytics`: Demand forecasting and performance measurement
- **Rules:**
  - `rules/odd/ride-hail/event_operations.yaml`: Event service parameters
  - `rules/policy/ride-hail/venue_access.yaml`: Venue-specific access and procedures
  - `rules/policy/ride-hail/surge_management.yaml`: High-volume handling and pricing
  - `rules/policy/ride-hail/virtual_queue.yaml`: Queue management and rider communication
- **External Systems:**
  - Event Management Platforms: Schedule and attendance data
  - Venue Management Systems: Zone coordination and access control
  - Traffic Management Systems: Road closures and traffic control

**Risks & Mitigations:**
- **Extreme demand spikes:**
  - Impact: High
  - Mitigation: Wave-based dispatch, virtual queuing, pre-booking incentives, clear rider expectations
- **Venue access restrictions:**
  - Impact: High
  - Mitigation: Pre-event coordination, dedicated lanes, venue-specific navigation, staff training
- **Communication challenges in crowded environments:**
  - Impact: Medium
  - Mitigation: Multi-modal rider communication, visual indicators, geo-precise pickup instructions
- **Competing services and informal pickups:**
  - Impact: Medium
  - Mitigation: Exclusive access agreements, clear zone advantages, rider education

## Validation & Deployment

**Acceptance / Test Hooks:**
- **Simulation Scenarios:**
  - `ride-hail/event/peak_throughput.json`: Maximum capacity handling
  - `ride-hail/event/zone_management.json`: Efficient zone operations
  - `ride-hail/event/multi_venue_coordination.json`: Complex event scenarios
- **Logs/Telemetry:**
  - Throughput metrics: rides per hour, zone utilization, dwell time
  - Rider metrics: wait time, walking distance, satisfaction scores
  - Operational metrics: vehicle positioning effectiveness, wave execution, exception handling
- **Gates:**
  - Peak throughput validation with controlled volume tests
  - Venue coordination verification with stakeholder sign-off
  - Rider experience assessment with targeted surveys

**Rollout Plan:**
- **Phase 1:** Single venue with moderate event size
- **Phase 2:** Multiple venues with varied event types
- **Phase 3:** City-wide event coordination with traffic authority integration
