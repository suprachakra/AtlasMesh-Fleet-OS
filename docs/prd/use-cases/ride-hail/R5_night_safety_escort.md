**ID:** R5  
**Name:** Late-Night Safety Escort Route Bias  
**Sector:** Ride-hail  
**Status:** Approved  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-13  
**Owner:** Ride-hail Sector Lead

## Use Case Definition

**Actors:**
- Primary: Riders (with safety concerns), Autonomous Vehicle
- Supporting: Safety Operations Team, City Safety Programs, Law Enforcement

**Trip Type:** SAFETY_RUN

**ODD (Operational Design Domain):**
- Geographic: Licensed districts with safety-scored route mapping
- Environmental: Night operations with enhanced sensing capabilities
- Time: Primarily evening/night hours (19:00-06:00)
- Communications: Urban LTE/5G with high reliability requirements
- Other: Enhanced safety features and monitoring

**Trigger:**
Rider selects safety mode or system automatically activates based on time/location

**Nominal Flow:**
1. Rider requests ride with safety mode enabled (explicit or time-based default)
2. System assigns vehicle with verified safety features and monitoring
3. Routing algorithm prioritizes well-lit arterials and safety-scored paths
4. Vehicle navigates to pickup with enhanced lighting and identification features
5. Rider verification includes additional safety confirmation options
6. During trip, system maintains safety-optimized routing despite minor time penalties
7. Enhanced monitoring of vehicle surroundings with safety-focused detection
8. Continuous route evaluation with real-time safety data integration
9. At destination, system selects well-lit dropoff point with safety considerations
10. Trip concludes with safety-specific feedback collection

**Variants / Edge Cases:**
- Safety concern during ride: Enhanced response protocols
- Route deviation requests: Safety evaluation before acceptance
- Well-lit route unavailable: Alternative safety measures and notifications
- High-risk area unavoidable: Enhanced monitoring and optional escort services
- Late-night public transport integration: Safe connection points

## Performance & Integration

**KPIs:**
- **P0 (Must have):**
  - Safety incidents: 0
  - Route safety score: ≥ 85/100
  - Wait time increase: ≤ policy-defined threshold (typically +20%)
  - Rider satisfaction: CSAT ≥ 4.7/5.0
- **P1 (Should have):**
  - Well-lit route percentage: ≥ 90% of trip distance
  - Safety feature utilization: ≥ 75% of eligible riders
  - Safety perception score: ≥ 4.8/5.0 (specific survey)
  - Incident prevention: Measurable reduction in safety alerts
