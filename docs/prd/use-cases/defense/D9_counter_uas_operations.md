**Sector:** Defense  
**Status:** Approved  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-14  
**Owner:** Defense Sector Lead

## Use Case Definition

**Actors:**
- Primary: Air Defense Operators, Security Forces
- Supporting: Intelligence Units, Command Staff, Electronic Warfare Teams

**Trip Type:** C_UAS_RUN

**ODD (Operational Design Domain):**
- Geographic: Base perimeters, forward operating locations, critical infrastructure
- Environmental: All weather conditions with appropriate sensor adjustments
- Time: 24/7 operations with day/night capabilities
- Communications: Secure tactical networks with local processing capability
- Other: Enhanced sensor suite for aerial threat detection

**Trigger:**
Airspace monitoring alerts, intelligence warnings, or scheduled security operations

**Nominal Flow:**
1. System detects potential UAS activity through multi-sensor fusion (RF, acoustic, optical, radar)
2. Autonomous ground vehicles are dispatched to optimal vantage points for triangulation
3. Sensor data is fused to classify UAS type, trajectory, and threat level
4. System determines appropriate response based on rules of engagement and threat assessment
5. Vehicles position to provide optimal sensor coverage and response capability
6. Detection and classification data is provided to air defense operators with response options
7. Upon authorization, appropriate countermeasures are coordinated (non-kinetic focus)
8. System tracks effectiveness of countermeasures and adjusts as needed
9. Incident data is logged with comprehensive technical and temporal details
10. After-action analysis improves detection signatures and response effectiveness

**Variants / Edge Cases:**
- Multiple simultaneous threats: Priority-based resource allocation
- Advanced UAS capabilities: Signature-based detection adaptation
- Degraded communications: Local decision making with preset authorities
- Civilian/authorized UAS discrimination: IFF integration and deconfliction
