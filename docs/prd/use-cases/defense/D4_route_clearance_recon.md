## Use Case Definition

**Actors:**
- Primary: Engineer Corps, Route Clearance Teams
- Supporting: Intelligence Units, Forward Operating Units, EOD Teams (follow-up)

**Trip Type:** RECON_RUN

**ODD (Operational Design Domain):**
- Geographic: Supply routes, patrol paths, forward deployment corridors
- Environmental: All terrain types with appropriate speed profiles, visibility ≥ 50m
- Time: Day/night operations with specialized sensor modes
- Communications: Secure comms with minimal emissions profile, store-and-forward capability
- Other: Slow-speed operation with high-fidelity perception focus

**Trigger:**
Scheduled route clearance operations or intelligence-driven priority assessment

**Nominal Flow:**
1. Intelligence and operations teams define priority routes for clearance
2. System plans detailed scan pattern with appropriate sensor configurations
3. UGV deploys with minimal escort requirement (reduced human exposure)
4. Low-speed, high-fidelity scanning with multi-modal sensor fusion (visual, IR, GPR, etc.)
5. Anomaly detection against baseline terrain and object models
6. Real-time classification of potential threats with confidence scoring
7. Precise geolocation and documentation of suspicious objects/areas
8. Generation of comprehensive route assessment with threat mapping
9. Data package preparation for EOD team follow-up as required
10. System maintains audit trail of all detections and classifications

**Variants / Edge Cases:**
- High-confidence threat detection: Safe distance maintenance and alert escalation
- Complex terrain navigation: Specialized mobility modes for difficult terrain
- Sensor interference: Adaptive sensing and cross-validation
- Communications degradation: Autonomous operation with local decision making
- Multiple threat scenario: Prioritization and optimal path planning

  - System health: sensor status, mobility performance, environmental conditions
- **Gates:**
  - Detection performance validation on standardized test range
  - False positive rate ≤ 5% over 50km of varied terrain
  - EOD team acceptance of documentation quality and usefulness

**Rollout Plan:**
- **Phase 1:** Controlled environment testing on known test ranges
- **Phase 2:** Limited deployment on low-risk routes with human supervision
- **Phase 3:** Expanded deployment with reduced supervision and increased autonomy

**Notes:**
This use case focuses on the detection and documentation of potential threats, not their neutralization. The system is designed to reduce human exposure to dangerous situations while improving the speed and thoroughness of route clearance operations. The clear separation between detection (this use case) and neutralization (handled by EOD teams) maintains operational safety while maximizing the benefits of autonomy.
