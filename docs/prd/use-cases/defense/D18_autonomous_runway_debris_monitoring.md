**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-14  
**Owner:** Defense Sector Lead

## Use Case Definition

**Actors:**
- Primary: Airfield Operations, Flight Safety Officers
- Supporting: Aircraft Maintenance, Air Traffic Control, Security Forces

**Trip Type:** RUNWAY_INSPECTION_RUN

**ODD (Operational Design Domain):**
- Geographic: Airfields, runways, taxiways, aprons
- Environmental: All weather conditions with appropriate sensor modes, temperature range -10°C to 55°C
- Time: 24/7 operations with priority during low-traffic periods
- Communications: Secure airfield network with ATC integration
- Other: Operation in active airfield environment with aircraft coordination

**Trigger:**
Scheduled inspection, post-aircraft operation, weather event, or debris alert

**Nominal Flow:**
1. System receives runway inspection mission with parameters and priority
2. ATC coordination establishes runway access window and constraints
3. Vehicle deploys with specialized FOD (Foreign Object Debris) detection systems
4. Navigation along precise runway inspection pattern with comprehensive coverage
5. Multi-sensor detection of debris using visual, infrared, and radar technologies
6. Real-time analysis with size, material, and hazard classification
7. Precise location marking of detected debris with imagery
8. Immediate alerting for critical FOD with removal coordination
9. Continuous monitoring during aircraft operations with rapid response capability
10. Comprehensive inspection reporting with trend analysis

**Variants / Edge Cases:**
- Aircraft emergency: Immediate runway clearance protocols
- Critical FOD detection: Rapid response and removal procedures
- Weather degradation: Sensor mode adaptation and confidence scoring
- Night operations: Infrared and illumination-assisted inspection
- Runway surface anomalies: Differentiation between FOD and surface features
