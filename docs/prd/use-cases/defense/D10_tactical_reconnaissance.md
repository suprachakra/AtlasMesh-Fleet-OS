# D10 — Tactical Reconnaissance

## Basic Information

**ID:** D10  
**Name:** Tactical Reconnaissance  
**Sector:** Defense  
**Status:** Approved  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-14  
**Owner:** Defense Sector Lead

## Use Case Definition

**Actors:**
- Primary: Intelligence Units, Tactical Commanders
- Supporting: UGVs, Sensor Operators, Data Analysts

**Trip Type:** RECON_RUN

**ODD (Operational Design Domain):**
- Geographic: Variable terrain, tactical areas of interest, limited infrastructure
- Environmental: All weather conditions with appropriate sensor modes, temperature range -10°C to 55°C
- Time: 24/7 operations with day/night capabilities
- Communications: SATCOM with local mesh networking, EMCON-compliant modes
- Other: Low-signature operations, extended mission duration

**Trigger:**
Intelligence requirements, pre-mission planning, or tactical situation development

**Nominal Flow:**
1. Intelligence team defines reconnaissance objectives and parameters
2. System generates optimal route and sensor employment plan
3. UGVs deploy with mission package and stealth parameters
4. Vehicles navigate to observation points with terrain masking
5. Multi-modal sensing collects required intelligence (EO/IR, SIGINT, etc.)
6. Data is processed locally with AI-assisted analysis
7. Priority intelligence is transmitted via secure, low-probability of detection communications
8. Full dataset is stored for retrieval or delayed transmission
9. Vehicles extract along separate routes to maintain operational security
10. System generates intelligence summary with geospatial tagging

**Variants / Edge Cases:**
- EMCON conditions: Store-and-forward with scheduled burst transmission
- Hostile detection risk: Evasion protocols and mission adaptation
