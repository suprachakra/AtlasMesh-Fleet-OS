# D6 — Border Corridor Logistics (Hub-to-Hub)

## Basic Information

**ID:** D6  
**Name:** Border Corridor Logistics (Hub-to-Hub)  
**Sector:** Defense  
**Status:** Approved  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-14  
**Owner:** Defense Sector Lead

## Use Case Definition

**Actors:**
- Primary: Logistics Command, Convoy Commander
- Supporting: Border Security, Customs Officials, Supply Chain Management

**Trip Type:** CORRIDOR_RUN

**ODD (Operational Design Domain):**
- Geographic: Established cross-border corridors with defined checkpoints
- Environmental: Desert conditions, temperature range -10°C to 55°C, dust/sand events
- Time: 24/7 operations with day/night capabilities
- Communications: Multi-layered comms (military LTE, SATCOM, mesh network)
- Other: Customs checkpoint workflow integration

**Trigger:**
Scheduled logistics operations or supply chain demand signals

**Nominal Flow:**
1. Logistics command generates cross-border movement request with cargo manifest
2. System validates cargo manifest against customs requirements and security protocols
3. Convoy composition and security requirements are determined based on cargo and threat assessment
4. Route planning incorporates checkpoint locations, processing times, and safe harbor points
5. Vehicles are dispatched with secure cargo verification and documentation
6. Convoy navigates to border checkpoint with appropriate spacing and formation
7. System facilitates customs processing through digital documentation exchange
8. Upon clearance, convoy continues through corridor with continuous monitoring
9. At destination hub, cargo verification and transfer procedures are executed
10. Mission completion with cargo receipt confirmation and documentation closure

**Variants / Edge Cases:**
- Customs delays: Dynamic rescheduling and safe harbor activation
- Security alert: Enhanced formation and defensive posture
- Documentation discrepancy: Exception handling with human intervention
- Convoy separation: Regroup protocols and status reporting
- Weather degradation: Adaptive routing and convoy spacing

## Performance & Integration

**KPIs:**
- **P0 (Must have):**
  - Border crossing efficiency: -30% processing time vs. manual operations
  - Mission completion rate: ≥98%
  - Documentation accuracy: 100% compliance with customs requirements
  - Security incident rate: 0
- **P1 (Should have):**
  - Fuel efficiency: +15% vs. conventional convoy
  - Convoy integrity maintenance: ≥99.5% uptime
  - Checkpoint wait time: -40% vs. baseline
  - Cargo verification accuracy: 100%

**Dependencies:**
- **Services:**
  - `dispatch`: Convoy planning and scheduling
  - `routing`: Border-aware route planning
  - `policy-engine`: Customs and security protocols
  - `fleet-health`: Vehicle status monitoring
  - `v2x-service`: Secure convoy communications
- **Rules:**
  - `rules/odd/defense/border_corridor.yaml`: Border corridor operational parameters
  - `rules/policy/defense/convoy_formation.yaml`: Formation and spacing rules
  - `rules/policy/defense/customs_processing.yaml`: Documentation and processing requirements
  - `rules/policy/security/cross_border.yaml`: Security protocols for border operations
- **External Systems:**
  - Customs Management System: Documentation and clearance
  - Border Security System: Checkpoint coordination
  - Supply Chain Management System: Cargo tracking and verification

**Risks & Mitigations:**
- **Documentation/customs rejection:**
  - Impact: High
  - Mitigation: Pre-validation, digital documentation with verification, exception handling procedures
- **Communications degradation at border:**
  - Impact: High
  - Mitigation: Multi-layer communications, store-and-forward protocols, local decision making
- **Security threat along corridor:**
  - Impact: Critical
  - Mitigation: Threat assessment integration, defensive formation options, security escort coordination
- **Geopolitical restrictions:**
  - Impact: High
  - Mitigation: Dynamic jurisdiction rule updates, diplomatic clearance verification

## Validation & Deployment

**Acceptance / Test Hooks:**
- **Simulation Scenarios:**
  - `defense/border/customs_processing.json`: Documentation and clearance workflows
  - `defense/border/communications_degradation.json`: Multi-layer comms failover
  - `defense/border/convoy_integrity.json`: Formation maintenance and recovery
- **Logs/Telemetry:**
  - Border crossing metrics: processing time, documentation status, exceptions
  - Convoy metrics: formation integrity, spacing, communications status
  - Security metrics: threat assessments, posture changes, incident reports
- **Gates:**
  - Documentation accuracy validation with customs authorities
  - Border crossing efficiency demonstration with time measurements
  - Security protocol compliance verification

**Rollout Plan:**
- **Phase 1:** Single border crossing with minimal cargo complexity
- **Phase 2:** Multiple crossing points with varied cargo types
- **Phase 3:** Full corridor operations with integrated customs processing
