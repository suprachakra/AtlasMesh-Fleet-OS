**Trigger:**
Supply requisition, scheduled distribution, or inventory management activities

**Nominal Flow:**
1. System receives supply movement tasks from logistics management system
2. Optimal task sequencing based on priority, location, and resource availability
3. Vehicle configuration selection based on cargo characteristics
4. Navigation to storage location with precise positioning for efficient access
5. Autonomous loading with verification of correct items and quantities
6. Secure transport to staging or loading area with collision avoidance
