# D12 — Autonomous Medical Evacuation

## Basic Information

**ID:** D12  
**Name:** Autonomous Medical Evacuation  
**Sector:** Defense  
**Status:** Approved  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-14  
**Owner:** Defense Sector Lead

## Use Case Definition

**Actors:**
- Primary: Medical Personnel, Casualty Evacuation Coordinators
- Supporting: Field Medics, Command Staff, Landing Zone Security

**Trip Type:** MEDEVAC_RUN

**ODD (Operational Design Domain):**
- Geographic: Established evacuation routes, field medical facilities, landing zones
- Environmental: All weather conditions with appropriate limitations, temperature range -10°C to 55°C
- Time: 24/7 operations with day/night capabilities
- Communications: Secure tactical networks with medical priority
- Other: Enhanced medical monitoring, casualty transport protocols

**Trigger:**
Medical evacuation request with casualty details and priority classification

**Nominal Flow:**
1. System receives MEDEVAC request with casualty information and location
2. Medical priority and urgency level determines response parameters
3. Optimal route is calculated considering terrain, threats, and time criticality
4. Vehicle deploys with appropriate medical configuration and supplies
5. En route preparation based on casualty information and treatment protocols
6. Arrival at casualty location with precise positioning for loading
7. Casualty loading with medical monitoring system integration
8. Transport to medical facility with continuous vital sign monitoring
9. Real-time medical data transmission to receiving facility
10. Handoff to medical personnel with complete casualty information transfer

**Variants / Edge Cases:**
- Multiple casualties: Triage-based configuration and routing
- Deteriorating patient condition: Treatment protocol adaptation
- Route obstruction: Dynamic replanning with medical priority
- Communications degradation: Autonomous decision making with medical protocols
- Landing zone security issues: Alternate LZ selection and coordination

## Performance & Integration

**KPIs:**
- **P0 (Must have):**
  - Response time: ≤15 minutes from request to arrival (in ODD)
  - Medical monitoring: Continuous vital signs with ≥99.9% reliability
  - Transport stability: Minimal acceleration/vibration within medical parameters
  - Successful evacuation rate: ≥98% completion to medical facility
- **P1 (Should have):**
  - Multi-casualty capacity: Optimal configuration for up to 4 casualties
  - Medical data transmission: Real-time vitals with ≤5s latency
  - Environmental control: Temperature/humidity within medical standards
  - Human exposure reduction: -90% in high-risk evacuation scenarios
