## Use Case Definition

**Actors:**
- Primary: Information Security Officers, Command Staff
- Supporting: Security Forces, Communications Units

**Trip Type:** DATA_COURIER_RUN

**ODD (Operational Design Domain):**
- Geographic: Secure facilities, designated courier routes
- Environmental: All weather conditions with appropriate adaptations, temperature range -10°C to 55°C
- Time: Scheduled or on-demand operations
- Communications: Minimal emissions with secure burst transmission capability
- Other: Enhanced physical and cyber security measures

**Trigger:**
Need to transfer sensitive data between disconnected or air-gapped networks

**Nominal Flow:**
1. Source facility loads encrypted data with multi-factor authentication
2. System generates optimal route with security-prioritized parameters
3. Vehicle deploys with tamper-evident seals and active monitoring
4. Continuous security verification throughout transit
5. Random route variations implemented based on security algorithm
6. Vehicle authenticates with destination facility using cryptographic protocols
7. Multi-factor authentication required for data transfer at destination
8. System logs complete chain of custody with cryptographic verification
9. Vehicle sanitizes any residual data after confirmed transfer
10. Mission completion report with security verification metrics

**Variants / Edge Cases:**
- Security alert: Evasive protocols and safe harbor procedures
- Authentication failure: Escalation and verification procedures
