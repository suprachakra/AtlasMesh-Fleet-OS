## Basic Information

**ID:** L16  
**Name:** Autonomous Order Fulfillment  
**Sector:** Logistics  
**Status:** Approved  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-14  
**Owner:** Logistics Sector Lead

## Use Case Definition

**Actors:**
- Primary: Fulfillment Operations, Order Management
- Supporting: Inventory Control, Quality Assurance, Shipping

**Trip Type:** ORDER_FULFILLMENT_RUN

**ODD (Operational Design Domain):**
- Geographic: Fulfillment centers, distribution warehouses, picking areas
- Environmental: Indoor controlled environment, temperature range 15°C to 30°C
- Time: 24/7 operations with peak handling periods
- Communications: Facility network with high-reliability coverage
- Other: Operation with specialized picking equipment and order management systems

**Trigger:**
Order release for fulfillment or batch processing requirement

**Nominal Flow:**
1. System receives order fulfillment mission with order details and requirements
2. Picking strategy determination based on order characteristics and inventory locations
3. Vehicle is equipped with appropriate picking attachments and verification tools
4. Route planning incorporates optimal picking sequence and facility layout
5. Navigation to initial pick location with precise positioning
6. Item identification with barcode/RFID verification and quality check
7. Secure item retrieval with appropriate handling based on product characteristics
8. Transport to next pick location or packing station via optimal route
9. Order consolidation with verification of completeness and accuracy
10. Handoff to packing operation with order documentation and special instructions

**Variants / Edge Cases:**
- Inventory discrepancies: Alternative item location and substitution protocols
- High-priority orders: Expedited picking and queue prioritization
- Fragile/special handling items: Enhanced handling procedures and packaging requirements
- Order changes during fulfillment: Dynamic replanning and adjustment
- Multi-order batch picking: Sorting and segregation procedures

## Performance & Integration

**KPIs:**
- **P0 (Must have):**
  - Picking accuracy: ≥99.8% correct items
  - Order completeness: ≥99.5% orders with all items
  - Throughput: Match or exceed manual picking rates
  - Handling quality: Zero product damage during picking
- **P1 (Should have):**
  - Path optimization: -30% travel distance vs. standard routes
  - Resource efficiency: Dynamic allocation based on order volume
  - Exception handling: ≤2 minutes for resolution initiation
  - Order prioritization: 100% adherence to service level agreements

**Dependencies:**
- **Services:**
  - `order-fulfillment-service`: Picking coordination and verification

  - Order Management System: Order details and priorities
  - Shipping System: Delivery requirements and carrier integration

**Risks & Mitigations:**
- **Picking errors:**
  - Impact: High
  - Mitigation: Multi-factor verification, weight/dimension validation, vision systems, quality checks
- **Inventory availability:**
  - Impact: High
  - Mitigation: Real-time inventory updates, alternative location checks, substitution protocols, exception handling
- **System integration failures:**
  - Impact: High
  - Mitigation: Offline capabilities, manual override options, robust API design, fallback procedures
- **Peak volume capacity:**
  - Impact: Medium
  - Mitigation: Scalable resources, dynamic allocation, prioritization protocols, workload balancing

## Validation & Deployment

**Acceptance / Test Hooks:**
- **Simulation Scenarios:**
  - `logistics/fulfillment/standard_picking.json`: Routine order fulfillment
  - `logistics/fulfillment/peak_volume.json`: High throughput operations
  - `logistics/fulfillment/special_handling.json`: Complex product requirements
- **Logs/Telemetry:**
  - Picking metrics: accuracy rates, cycle times, exception handling, verification confidence
  - Operational metrics: throughput, resource utilization, path efficiency, order completion time
  - Quality metrics: handling parameters, damage incidents, packing readiness
- **Gates:**
