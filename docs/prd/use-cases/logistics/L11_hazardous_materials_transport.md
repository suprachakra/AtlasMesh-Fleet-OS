**Trip Type:** HAZMAT_RUN

**ODD (Operational Design Domain):**
- Geographic: Designated HAZMAT routes, restricted areas, specialized facilities
- Environmental: Weather constraints based on material classification, temperature range appropriate to cargo
- Time: Scheduled operations with route timing restrictions
- Communications: Continuous monitoring with emergency response integration
- Other: Enhanced safety protocols, specialized containment monitoring

**Trigger:**
Approved HAZMAT shipment with proper documentation and clearances

**Nominal Flow:**
1. System validates HAZMAT documentation and placarding requirements
2. Route planning incorporates material-specific restrictions and regulations
3. Vehicle undergoes specialized pre-trip inspection for HAZMAT transport
4. Loading occurs with proper containment verification and documentation
5. Transport follows designated HAZMAT routes with continuous monitoring
6. System maintains appropriate separation from other vehicles and sensitive areas
7. Environmental and cargo condition monitoring throughout transport
8. Regular status updates to compliance systems and stakeholders
9. Arrival at destination with proper handling protocols
10. Complete documentation generated for regulatory compliance

**Variants / Edge Cases:**
- Containment anomaly: Detection and response protocols
- Route restriction: Dynamic replanning with regulatory compliance
- Weather hazard: Safe harbor procedures based on material class
