**Name:** Autonomous Parcel Sorting  
**Sector:** Logistics  
**Status:** Approved  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-14  
**Owner:** Logistics Sector Lead

## Use Case Definition

**Actors:**
- Primary: Sorting Operations, Distribution Center Management
- Supporting: Transportation Planning, Last-Mile Delivery, Quality Control

**Trip Type:** PARCEL_SORTING_RUN

**ODD (Operational Design Domain):**
- Geographic: Sorting facilities, distribution centers, parcel hubs
- Environmental: Indoor controlled environment, temperature range 15°C to 30°C
- Time: 24/7 operations with peak handling periods
- Communications: Facility network with high-reliability coverage
- Other: Operation with specialized sorting equipment and destination routing systems

**Trigger:**
Inbound parcel arrival or scheduled sort batch requirement

**Nominal Flow:**
1. System receives parcel sorting mission with batch details and sort requirements
2. Sorting strategy determination based on destination, service level, and parcel characteristics
3. Vehicle is equipped with appropriate handling attachments and scanning equipment
4. Route planning incorporates optimal sort sequence and facility layout
5. Navigation to inbound staging area with precise positioning
6. Parcel identification with barcode/RFID scanning and dimensional verification
7. Secure parcel retrieval with appropriate handling based on package characteristics
8. Destination determination with routing code assignment and verification
9. Transport to appropriate sort lane or bin via optimal route
10. Placement confirmation with sort verification and exception handling

**Variants / Edge Cases:**
- Non-machinable parcels: Special handling procedures and manual sort routing
- Damaged packaging: Exception handling and repackaging coordination
- High-priority shipments: Expedited sorting and special handling
- Mis-labeled items: Secondary identification methods and resolution procedures
- Sort plan changes: Dynamic reassignment and rerouting capabilities

## Performance & Integration

**KPIs:**
- **P0 (Must have):**
  - Sorting accuracy: ≥99.9% correct destination assignment
  - Throughput: ≥1,000 parcels per hour per line
  - Handling quality: ≤0.1% parcels damaged during sorting
  - Exception handling: ≤30 seconds for resolution initiation
- **P1 (Should have):**
  - Resource efficiency: +25% vs. manual sorting
  - Dynamic capacity: Ability to scale with volume fluctuations
  - Special handling: 100% identification of non-machinable items
  - Sort plan adaptation: Real-time adjustment to transportation changes

**Dependencies:**

  - Impact: Medium
  - Mitigation: Multiple identification methods, OCR backup, machine vision, exception handling

## Validation & Deployment

**Acceptance / Test Hooks:**
- **Simulation Scenarios:**
  - `logistics/sorting/standard_operation.json`: Routine parcel sorting
  - `logistics/sorting/peak_volume.json`: High throughput operations
  - `logistics/sorting/special_handling.json`: Non-standard package management
- **Logs/Telemetry:**
  - Sorting metrics: accuracy rates, throughput, exception rates, handling parameters
  - Operational metrics: resource utilization, sort plan compliance, cycle times
  - Quality metrics: damage incidents, scan confidence, placement accuracy
- **Gates:**
  - Operations team acceptance of sorting performance
  - Transportation planning validation of sort plan compliance
