## Use Case Definition

**Actors:**
- Primary: Cold Chain Manager, Distribution Center Operations, Store Receiving
- Supporting: Quality Assurance, Fleet Maintenance, Regulatory Compliance

**Trip Type:** COLD_CHAIN_RUN

**ODD (Operational Design Domain):**
- Geographic: Distribution center to retail/grocery stores, primarily urban/suburban routes
- Environmental: All weather conditions with temperature impact considerations
- Time: 24/7 operations with emphasis on off-peak delivery windows
- Communications: Urban LTE/5G with local storage for temperature logs
- Other: Temperature-controlled cargo area with continuous monitoring

**Trigger:**
Scheduled delivery windows or dynamic inventory replenishment

**Nominal Flow:**
1. WMS prepares temperature-sensitive order with specific handling requirements
2. System verifies refrigeration unit status and pre-cools cargo area to specification
3. Loading dock personnel load products with temperature verification
4. System captures loading documentation and initiates temperature monitoring
5. Vehicle navigates to destination with temperature-aware routing (shade, duration)
6. Continuous monitoring of cargo temperature with alerts for any deviation
7. Upon arrival, system verifies receiving location and coordinates unloading
8. Temperature log is transferred with delivery confirmation
9. System performs post-delivery refrigeration system check
10. Quality assurance receives complete temperature chain documentation

**Variants / Edge Cases:**
- Temperature excursion: Emergency protocols and notification
- Equipment malfunction: Backup systems and contingency routing
- Delivery window constraints: Dynamic scheduling with temperature priority
- Multiple temperature zones: Zone-specific monitoring and management
