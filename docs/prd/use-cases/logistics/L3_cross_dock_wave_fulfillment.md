# L3 — Cross-Dock Wave Fulfillment

## Basic Information

**ID:** L3  
**Name:** Cross-Dock Wave Fulfillment  
**Sector:** Logistics  
**Status:** Approved  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-13  
**Owner:** Logistics Sector Lead

## Use Case Definition

**Actors:**
- Primary: Warehouse Operations Manager, Wave Planning Team
- Supporting: Dock Personnel, Pallet Handlers, WMS System

**Trip Type:** CROSS_DOCK_RUN

**ODD (Operational Design Domain):**
- Geographic: Indoor warehouse environment with designated lanes and zones
- Environmental: Controlled indoor conditions, temperature range 5°C to 40°C
- Time: Operations aligned with inbound/outbound schedules and wave planning
- Communications: Warehouse WiFi with comprehensive coverage
- Other: Mixed traffic with pedestrians, manual equipment, and other automated systems

**Trigger:**
WMS wave release with time-bound fulfillment requirements

**Nominal Flow:**
1. WMS publishes wave plan with pallet movements between inbound and outbound docks
2. System optimizes movement sequence based on priority, timing, and dock constraints
3. Autonomous pallet carriers are dispatched with optimized routes and sequencing
4. Carriers navigate to inbound locations with precision positioning for pallet pickup
5. Vision-guided pallet engagement with verification of correct pallet and condition
6. Carriers transport pallets through warehouse with pedestrian-aware navigation
7. Precise placement at outbound staging locations based on load planning requirements
8. System confirms placement and updates WMS with completion status
9. Continuous rebalancing of carrier fleet based on wave progress and priorities
10. Performance metrics tracked against wave completion targets and SLAs

**Variants / Edge Cases:**
- Wave priority changes: Dynamic resequencing of movements
- Pallet identification issues: Exception handling and verification procedures
- Path obstruction: Dynamic rerouting and congestion management
- Dock congestion: Staging area utilization and queue management
- Equipment failure: Rapid reassignment and recovery procedures

## Performance & Integration

**KPIs:**
- **P0 (Must have):**
  - Wave completion rate: ≥ 95% within time window
  - Pallet movement accuracy: ≥ 99.9% correct placements
  - Throughput increase: +10-15% vs. manual operation
  - Safety incidents: 0
- **P1 (Should have):**
  - Equipment utilization: ≥ 85%
  - Energy efficiency: +20% vs. manual operation
  - Congestion reduction: -30% in high-traffic areas
  - Exception handling time: ≤ 2 minutes per incident

**Dependencies:**
- **Services:**
  - `adapters/wms`: Integration with Warehouse Management System
  - `dispatch`: Pallet carrier assignment and sequencing
  - `routing`: Indoor path planning with congestion awareness
  - `analytics`: Wave performance tracking and optimization
- **Rules:**
  - `rules/odd/logistics/indoor_warehouse_rules.yaml`: Indoor operation parameters
  - `rules/policy/logistics/wave_priority.yaml`: Movement prioritization policies
  - `rules/policy/logistics/pallet_handling.yaml`: Pallet engagement and placement requirements

- **External Systems:**
  - Warehouse Management System: Wave planning and tracking
  - Dock Management System: Door assignments and scheduling
  - Labor Management System: Staff coordination and task assignment

**Risks & Mitigations:**
- **WMS integration reliability:**
  - Impact: High
  - Mitigation: Transaction logging, error recovery, manual override capability
- **Pedestrian safety in mixed traffic:**
  - Impact: High
  - Mitigation: Multi-sensor detection, speed controls, clear path markings, warning systems
- **Pallet identification errors:**
  - Impact: Medium
  - Mitigation: Multi-factor verification, barcode/RFID redundancy, exception workflows
- **Wave timing conflicts:**
  - Impact: Medium
  - Mitigation: Dynamic prioritization, buffer capacity planning, real-time rescheduling

## Validation & Deployment

**Acceptance / Test Hooks:**
- **Simulation Scenarios:**
  - `logistics/cross_dock/wave_completion.json`: Full wave fulfillment simulation
  - `logistics/cross_dock/congestion_management.json`: Peak traffic handling
  - `logistics/cross_dock/exception_handling.json`: Various error conditions
- **Logs/Telemetry:**
  - Wave metrics: completion rates, timing, exceptions
  - Movement metrics: accuracy, cycle times, utilization
  - Traffic metrics: congestion levels, path efficiency, conflict resolution
- **Gates:**
  - Digital twin validation with historical wave data
  - Throughput improvement ≥ 10% in simulation
  - Field validation with incremental wave complexity

**Rollout Plan:**
- **Phase 1:** Limited carrier fleet during single shift operations
- **Phase 2:** Multiple shifts with expanded fleet and wave types
- **Phase 3:** Full integration with dynamic wave planning and optimization
