## Use Case Definition

**Actors:**
- Primary: Returns Department, Warehouse Operations
- Supporting: Quality Control, Inventory Management, Customer Service

**Trip Type:** RETURNS_PROCESSING_RUN

**ODD (Operational Design Domain):**
- Geographic: Returns processing centers, distribution facilities, sorting areas
- Environmental: Indoor controlled environment, temperature range 15°C to 30°C
- Time: Primarily business hours with extended operations during peak periods
- Communications: Facility network with high-reliability coverage
- Other: Operation with specialized inspection equipment and returns management systems

**Trigger:**
Returns arrival batch or scheduled processing requirement

**Nominal Flow:**
1. System receives returns processing mission with batch details and processing requirements
2. Return type classification and handling requirements determination
3. Vehicle is equipped with appropriate handling attachments and inspection tools
4. Route planning incorporates facility layout and processing station sequence
5. Navigation to returns receiving area with precise positioning
6. Item identification with barcode/RFID verification and initial inspection
7. Transport to appropriate processing station based on return type
8. Assistance with detailed inspection and condition assessment
9. Routing to disposition location (restocking, refurbishment, recycling, disposal)
10. Processing documentation with disposition decision and inventory update

**Variants / Edge Cases:**
- Damaged items: Special handling procedures and documentation
- High-value returns: Enhanced verification and security protocols
- Hazardous materials: Specialized handling and regulatory compliance
- Bulk returns: Batch processing optimization and sorting
- Unidentified items: Exception handling and manual intervention

## Performance & Integration

**KPIs:**
- **P0 (Must have):**
  - Processing accuracy: ≥98% correct disposition decisions
  - Throughput: ≥50 items per hour per vehicle
  - Documentation completeness: 100% returns with proper tracking
  - Handling safety: Zero item damage during processing
- **P1 (Should have):**
  - Processing time: -30% vs. manual operation
  - Exception handling: ≤3 minutes for resolution initiation
  - Resource optimization: Dynamic allocation based on return volume
  - Customer credit speed: Same-day processing for standard returns

  - Impact: High
  - Mitigation: Prioritization protocols, streamlined processing, automated verification, status tracking

## Validation & Deployment

**Acceptance / Test Hooks:**
- **Simulation Scenarios:**
  - `logistics/returns/standard_processing.json`: Routine returns handling
  - `logistics/returns/damaged_items.json`: Special condition assessment
  - `logistics/returns/peak_volume.json`: High throughput operations
- **Logs/Telemetry:**
  - Processing metrics: disposition accuracy, inspection time, handling parameters
  - Operational metrics: throughput, queue lengths, exception rates, resource utilization
  - Integration metrics: system connectivity, inventory updates, customer notifications
- **Gates:**
