**Trip Type:** CROSS_DOCK_TRANSFER_RUN

**ODD (Operational Design Domain):**
- Geographic: Cross-dock facilities, warehouse yards, loading bays
- Environmental: Primarily indoor/covered with outdoor yard segments, temperature range -10°C to 45°C
- Time: 24/7 operations with peak handling periods
- Communications: Facility network with high-reliability coverage
- Other: Operation with specialized material handling equipment and load tracking systems

**Trigger:**
Inbound freight arrival or scheduled transfer requirement

**Nominal Flow:**
1. System receives cross-dock transfer mission with freight details and destination
2. Load characteristics assessment and handling requirements determination
3. Vehicle is equipped with appropriate material handling attachments
4. Route planning incorporates facility layout and traffic patterns
5. Navigation to inbound staging area with precise positioning
6. Freight identification with barcode/RFID verification
7. Secure loading with weight distribution and stability verification
8. Transport to outbound staging area via optimal route
9. Precise positioning at destination dock with alignment verification
10. Unloading with confirmation of placement and transfer documentation

**Variants / Edge Cases:**
- Oversized or irregular freight: Specialized handling procedures and equipment
- High-priority transfers: Expedited routing and queue prioritization
- Damaged packaging: Exception handling and documentation protocols
