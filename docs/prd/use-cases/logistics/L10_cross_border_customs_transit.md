# L10 — Cross-Border Customs Transit

## Basic Information

**ID:** L10  
**Name:** Cross-Border Customs Transit  
**Sector:** Logistics  
**Status:** Approved  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-14  
**Owner:** Logistics Sector Lead

## Use Case Definition

**Actors:**
- Primary: Customs Authorities, Freight Forwarders
- Supporting: Border Security, Logistics Operators, Regulatory Compliance

**Trip Type:** CUSTOMS_TRANSIT_RUN

**ODD (Operational Design Domain):**
- Geographic: Border crossing zones, customs areas, designated transit corridors
- Environmental: All weather conditions with appropriate adaptations, temperature range -10°C to 55°C
- Time: Aligned with border operating hours, typically 24/7
- Communications: Cross-border network handover, local processing capability
- Other: Operation in high-security areas with specialized protocols

**Trigger:**
Scheduled cross-border shipment with pre-filed customs documentation

**Nominal Flow:**
1. System receives customs pre-clearance with digital documentation
2. Vehicle is loaded with cargo and electronic seals are applied
3. Autonomous transit begins with route optimized for border crossing efficiency
4. Upon approach to border, system initiates customs notification protocol
5. Vehicle navigates to designated inspection lane with precise positioning
6. System provides digital documentation and cargo manifest to authorities
7. Vehicle supports inspection process with camera feeds and sensor access
8. Upon clearance, system receives digital authorization to proceed
9. Vehicle continues to destination with intact electronic seals
10. System generates comprehensive transit record for compliance documentation

**Variants / Edge Cases:**
- Secondary inspection: Cooperative protocols for detailed examination
- Documentation discrepancy: Exception handling and resolution support
- Multi-jurisdiction transit: Sequential border crossing management
- Restricted goods: Enhanced security and monitoring protocols
- Customs system outage: Fallback to manual procedures with digital backup

## Performance & Integration

**KPIs:**
- **P0 (Must have):**
  - Border crossing time: -30% vs. manual process
  - Documentation accuracy: 100% compliance with requirements
  - Inspection cooperation: 100% adherence to authority instructions
  - Chain of custody: Zero compromise events
- **P1 (Should have):**
  - Predictive border wait times: ±15% accuracy
  - Customs relationship score: ≥4.5/5 authority satisfaction
  - Transit cost reduction: -15% through optimization
  - Exception resolution time: ≤30 minutes for documentation issues

**Dependencies:**
- **Services:**
  - `customs-service`: Documentation management and authority interface
  - `routing`: Border-aware path planning with wait time prediction
  - `policy-engine`: Jurisdiction-specific compliance rules
  - `security-monitoring`: Cargo integrity and electronic seal verification
  - `adapters/customs`: Integration with customs systems
- **Rules:**
  - `rules/odd/logistics/border_crossing.yaml`: Border-specific parameters
  - `rules/policy/logistics/customs_procedures.yaml`: Documentation and inspection protocols
  - `rules/policy/compliance/chain_of_custody.yaml`: Cargo security requirements
  - `rules/policy/logistics/jurisdiction_handover.yaml`: Cross-border transition procedures
- **External Systems:**
  - Customs Management System: Documentation and clearance
  - Electronic Seal System: Cargo security and integrity
  - Trade Documentation System: Commercial and regulatory paperwork

**Risks & Mitigations:**
- **Documentation compliance failure:**
  - Impact: High
  - Mitigation: Pre-validation, digital redundancy, exception handling procedures
- **Border authority interaction:**
  - Impact: High
  - Mitigation: Clear cooperation protocols, authority override capability, training programs
- **Cross-border communications transition:**
  - Impact: Medium
  - Mitigation: Multi-carrier capability, local caching, graceful handover
- **Regulatory differences between jurisdictions:**
  - Impact: Medium
  - Mitigation: Jurisdiction-specific rule sets, dynamic policy loading, compliance verification

## Validation & Deployment

**Acceptance / Test Hooks:**
- **Simulation Scenarios:**
  - `logistics/customs/standard_crossing.json`: Normal border procedures
  - `logistics/customs/secondary_inspection.json`: Detailed examination protocols
  - `logistics/customs/documentation_exception.json`: Issue resolution procedures
- **Logs/Telemetry:**
  - Transit metrics: crossing times, wait periods, processing efficiency
  - Compliance metrics: documentation accuracy, inspection cooperation
  - Security metrics: seal integrity, chain of custody verification
- **Gates:**
  - Border authority acceptance of autonomous interaction
  - Documentation compliance verification across jurisdictions
  - Security protocol validation with simulated exceptions

**Rollout Plan:**
- **Phase 1:** Single border crossing with simplified cargo
- **Phase 2:** Multiple crossing points with varied cargo types
- **Phase 3:** Full integration with customs pre-clearance systems
