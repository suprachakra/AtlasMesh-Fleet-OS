# Requirements Specification (FRs & NFRs)

## 1) Scope & Goals

### Problem Statement
Fleet operators struggle with environmental brittleness (98% uptime lost to weather/dust), integration complexity (6+ months per vehicle type), compliance nightmares (manual evidence collection), vendor lock-in (single-source dependencies), and operational inefficiency (40%+ manual intervention rates).

### Goals
- **Environmental Resilience**: ≥99.5% uptime in 50°C+, dust storms, GNSS denial
- **Integration Speed**: <2 weeks vehicle onboarding vs. 6+ months industry standard

- **Vendor Freedom**: Multi-vendor support across vehicles, sensors, maps, clouds
- **Operational Efficiency**: ≤0.5 assists/1000km vs. industry 2.0+ rate

### Out of Scope
- Consumer passenger vehicles (focus: commercial/industrial fleets)
- Level 5 full autonomy (focus: Level 4 with ODD constraints)
- Custom hardware development (focus: software platform)

### Success Criteria → OKR Mapping
