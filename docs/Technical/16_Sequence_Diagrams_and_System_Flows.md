# AtlasMesh Fleet OS â€” Sequence Diagrams & System Flows

## 1) Overview

This document provides comprehensive sequence diagrams for critical system flows in the AtlasMesh Fleet OS. These diagrams illustrate the interactions between services, data flow, and decision points for key operational scenarios.

**Note**: The actual sequence diagrams are now stored as separate files in `/docs/diagrams/sequence/business-flows/` for better maintainability and version control.

## 2) Trip Lifecycle - Complete Flow

**Diagram**: [`trip_lifecycle_complete_v1.mmd`](../../diagrams/sequence/business-flows/trip_lifecycle_complete_v1.mmd)

This diagram shows the complete trip lifecycle from creation to completion, including:
- Trip creation and policy validation
- Route planning and optimization
- Vehicle assignment and dispatch
- Real-time trip execution with telemetry
- Policy monitoring and compliance checks
- Trip completion and audit logging

## 3) Vehicle Onboarding & Registration

**Diagram**: [`vehicle_onboarding_registration_v1.mmd`](../../diagrams/sequence/business-flows/vehicle_onboarding_registration_v1.mmd)

This diagram illustrates the complete vehicle onboarding process, including:
- Initial vehicle registration and profile validation
- Policy evaluation for onboarding approval
- Secure certificate and key generation
- Zero-trust identity registration (SPIFFE)
- Vehicle agent bootstrap and authentication
- Continuous health monitoring establishment

## 4) OTA Update Flow

**Diagram**: [`ota_update_flow_v1.mmd`](../../diagrams/sequence/business-flows/ota_update_flow_v1.mmd)

This diagram shows the complete over-the-air update process, including:
- Update package preparation and cryptographic signing
- Policy evaluation for update approval
- Staged rollout to vehicle cohorts
- Secure download and signature verification
- Pre-installation policy checks
- A/B deployment with rollback capability
- Evidence generation for compliance

## 5) Predictive Maintenance Workflow

**Diagram**: [`predictive_maintenance_workflow_v1.mmd`](../../diagrams/sequence/business-flows/predictive_maintenance_workflow_v1.mmd)

This diagram illustrates the predictive maintenance process, including:
- Continuous diagnostic data collection from vehicles
- Feature extraction and ML model inference
- Remaining Useful Life (RUL) predictions
- Work order generation and scheduling
- Proactive fleet management decisions
- Model performance monitoring and retraining

## 6) Security Incident Response

**Diagram**: [`security_incident_response_v1.mmd`](../../diagrams/sequence/business-flows/security_incident_response_v1.mmd)

This diagram shows the security incident detection and response process, including:
- Anomaly detection and threat correlation
- Incident classification and severity assessment
- Immediate response actions (access revocation, secret rotation)
- Forensic evidence collection and investigation
- Recovery process and access restoration
- Post-incident activities and policy updates

## 7) Evidence Generation & Compliance Audit

**Diagram**: [`evidence_generation_compliance_v1.mmd`](../../diagrams/sequence/business-flows/evidence_generation_compliance_v1.mmd)

This diagram illustrates the automated evidence generation and compliance process, including:
- Continuous evidence collection from trip events and policy decisions
- Scheduled evidence bundle generation with cryptographic signing
- Compliance report generation per regulatory requirements
- Regulatory submission and validation process
- Continuous monitoring and automated mitigation

## 8) Multi-Tenant Sector Overlay Activation

**Diagram**: [`multi_tenant_sector_overlay_v1.mmd`](../../diagrams/sequence/business-flows/multi_tenant_sector_overlay_v1.mmd)

This diagram shows the dynamic sector overlay activation process, including:
- Tenant authentication and entitlement validation
- Sector-specific policy loading and activation
- Feature flag activation for sector customizations
- Dynamic policy application during user sessions
- UI customizations and branding application
