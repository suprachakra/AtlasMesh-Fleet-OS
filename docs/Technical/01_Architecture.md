## 3) Component Architecture Principles

AtlasMesh Fleet OS is built on the following architectural principles:

### 3.1 Agnostic by Design

The system is designed to be agnostic across multiple dimensions:

- **Vehicle-agnostic**: Abstracted drive-by-wire interfaces, sensor fusion, and vehicle capabilities
- **Platform-agnostic**: Cloud-neutral deployment, containerized services, infrastructure as code
- **Sector-agnostic**: Policy-driven behavior, configurable workflows, domain-specific overlays
- **Sensor-agnostic**: Abstracted sensor interfaces, fusion algorithms, and degraded mode operations
- **Map-agnostic**: Multiple map provider support, provenance tracking, freshness/credibility tradeoffs
- **Weather-agnostic**: Multi-source weather data fusion, confidence scoring, and fallback strategies
- **Comms-agnostic**: Multi-layer communication stack, store-and-forward capabilities, offline operation

### 3.2 Service-Oriented Architecture

The system follows a service-oriented architecture with the following characteristics:

- **Microservices**: Bounded contexts with clear interfaces and responsibilities
- **Event-driven**: Event sourcing for state changes, event-based integration patterns
- **API-first**: Well-defined APIs with versioning, contract tests, and documentation
- **Stateless services**: Externalized state for scalability and resilience
- **Idempotent operations**: Safe retries and exactly-once semantics where needed

### 3.3 Security & Compliance by Design

Security and compliance are fundamental to the architecture:

- **Zero-trust networking**: mTLS for all service communication, SPIFFE/SPIRE for identity
- **Policy as code**: OPA/Rego policies for authorization and business rules
- **Evidence generation**: Automated safety case artifacts, audit trails, and compliance documentation
- **Secure by default**: Least privilege, encryption in transit and at rest, secrets management
- **Verifiable builds**: Reproducible builds, signed artifacts, SBOM generation

## 6) Failure Domains & Resilience

AtlasMesh Fleet OS is designed with resilience in mind, with the following failure domains and mitigation strategies:

### 6.1 Communication Failures

| Failure Mode | Impact | Mitigation |
|--------------|--------|------------|
